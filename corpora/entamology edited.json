    "insectposition": " Although the insects form but a single class of the animal kingdom, they are yet so numerous in orders, families, genera, and species, their habits and transformations are so full of instruction to the biologist, and they affect human interests in such a variety of ways, that they have always attracted more attention from students than any other class of animals, the number of entomologists greatly surpassing that of ornithologists, ichthyologists, or the special students of any other class, while the literature has assumed immense proportions. Insects form about four-fifths of the animal kingdom. There are about 250,000 species already named and contained in our museums, while the number of living and fossil species in all is estimated to amount to between one and two millions.In their structure insects are perhaps more complicated than any other animals. This is partly due to the serial arrangement of the segments and the consequent segmental repetition of organs, especially of the external appendages, and of the muscles, the trache\u00c3\u00a6, and the nerves. The brain is nearly or quite as complicated as that of the higher vertebrates, while the sense-organs, especially those of touch, sight, and smell are, as a rule, far more numerous and only less complex than those of vertebrates. Moreover, in their psychical development, certain insects are equal, or even superior, to any other animals, except birds and mammals. The animal kingdom is primarily divided into two grand divisions, the one-celled (Protozoa) and many-celled animals (Metazoa). In the latter group the cells and tissues forming the body are arranged in three fundamental cell-layers; viz. the ectoderm or outer layer, the mesoderm, and endoderm. The series of branches, or phyla, comprised 2under the term Metazoa are the Porifera, C\u00c5\u201clenterata, Vermes, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata.",
    "insectrelation": "The insects by general consent stand at the head of the     Arthropoda. Their bodies are quite as much complicated or     specialized, and indeed, when we consider the winged forms, more so, than any other class of the branch, and besides this they have     wings, fitting them for an a\u00ebrial life. It is with little doubt that to their     power of flight, and thus of escaping the attacks of their creeping     arthropod enemies, insects owe, so to speak, their success in life; i.e.     their numerical superiority in individuals, species, and genera. It is\n    also apparently their power of moving or swimming swiftly from one\n    place to another which has led to the numerical superiority in species\n    of fishes to other Vertebrata. Among terrestrial vertebrates, the\n    birds, by virtue of their ability to fly, greatly surpass in number of\n    species the reptiles and mammals.\n    The Arthropoda are in general characterized by having the body\n    composed of segments (somites or arthromeres) bearing jointed\n    appendages. They differ from the worms in having segmented\n    appendages, i.e. antenn\u00e6, jaws, and legs, instead of the soft\n    unjointed outgrowths of the annelid worms. Moreover, their bodies\n    are composed of a more or less definite number of segments or rings,\n    grouped either into a head-thorax (cephalothorax) and hind-body, as\n    in Crustacea, or into a head differentiated from the rest of the body\n    (trunk), the latter not being divided into a distinct thorax and\n    abdomen, as in Myriopoda; or into three usually quite distinct\n    regions\u2014the head, thorax, and hind-body or abdomen, as in insects.\n    In certain aberrant, modified forms, as the Tardigrada, or the\n    Pantopoda, and the mites, the body is not differentiated into such\n    definite regions.\n    In their internal organs arthropods agree in their general relations\n    with the higher worms, hence most zo\u00f6logists agree that they have\n    directly originated from the annelid worms.The position and general shape of the digestive canal, of the\nnervous and circulatory systems, are the same in Arthropoda as in\nannelid (oligochete) worms, so much so that it is generally thought\nthat the Arthropoda are the direct descendants of the worms. It is\nbecoming evident, however, that there was no common ancestor of\nthe Arthropoda as a whole, and that the group is a polyphyletic one.\nHence, though a convenient group, it is a somewhat artificial one,\nand may eventually be dismembered into at least three or four phyla\nor branches.",
    "crustacea": "We will now rapidly review the leading features of the classes of\nArthropoda.\nThe Crustacea.\u2014These Arthropoda are in many most important\ncharacteristics unlike the insects; they have two pairs of antenn\u00e6,\nfive pairs of buccal appendages, and they are branchiate Arthropoda.\nThey have evidently originated entirely independently, and by a\ndirect line of descent from some unknown annelid ancestor which\nwas either a many-segmented worm, with parapodia, or the two\ngroups together with the Rotifera may have originated from a\ncommon appendigerous Trochosph\u00e6ra. Their segments in the higher\nforms are definite in number (23 or 24) and arranged into two\nregions, a head-thorax (cephalothorax) and hind-body (abdomen).\nNearly all the segments, both of the cephalothorax and abdomen,\nbear a pair of jointed limbs, and to them at their base are, in the\nhigher forms, appended the gills (branchi\u00e6). The limbs are in the\nmore specialized forms (shrimps and crabs) differentiated into eye\u0002stalks, two pairs of antenn\u00e6, a pair of palpus-bearing jaws\n(mandibles), two pairs of maxill\u00e6 and three pairs of maxillipeds;\nthese appendages being biramose, and the latter bearing gills\nattached to their basal joints. The legs are further differentiated into\nambulatory thoracic legs and into swimming or abdominal legs, and\nin the latter the first pair of the male is modified into copulatory\norgans (gonopoda). The male and female reproductive organs as a\nrule are in separate individuals, hermaphrodites being very unusual,\nand the glands may be paired or single. The sexual outlets are\ngenerally paired, and, as in the male lobster and other Macrura, open\nin the basal joint of the last pair of legs, and in the female in the third from the last; while originally in all Crustacea the sexual organs were\nmost probably paired (Fig. 3, B).\nThey are, except a few land Isopoda, aquatic, mostly marine, and\nwhen they have a metamorphosis, pass through a six-legged larval\nstage, called the Nauplius, the shrimps and crabs passing through an\nadditional stage, the Zo\u00eba. Crustacea also differ much from insects in\nthe highly modified nature of the nephridia, which are usually\nrepresented by the green gland of the lobster, or the shell-glands of\nthe Phyllopoda, which open out in one of the head-segments; also in\nthe possession of a pair of large digestive glands, the so-called liver.\nIntermediate in some respects between the Crustacea and insects,\nbut more primitive, in respect to what are perhaps the most weighty\ncharacters, than the Crustacea, are the Trilobita, the Merostomata\n(Limulus), and, finally, the Arachnida, these being allied groups. In\nthe Trilobita and Merostomata (Limulus), the head-appendages are\nmore like feet than jaws, while they have in most respects a similar\nmode of embryonic development, the larval forms being also similar.",
    "merostomata": "\nThe Merostomata.\u2014The only living form, Limulus, is\nundoubtedly a very primitive type, as the genital glands and ducts\nare double, opening wide apart on the basal pair of abdominal legs\n(Fig. 3). Moreover, their head-appendages, which are single, with\nspines on the basal joint, are very primitive and morphologically\nnearer in shape to those of the worms (Syllid\u00e6, etc.) than even those\nof the Crustacea. Besides, their four pairs of coxal glands, with an\nexternal opening at the base of the fifth pair of head-appendages,\nand which probably are modified nephridia (Crustacea having but a\nsingle pair in any one form, either opening out on the second\nantennal, green gland, or second maxillary, shell-gland, segment),\nindicate a closer approximation to the polynephrous worms. Limulus\nhas other archaic features, especially as regards the structure of the\nsimple and compound eyes and the simple nature of the brain.",
    "trilobita":"\nThe Trilobita.\u2014These archaic forms are still more generalized\nand primitive than the Merostomata and Crustacea, and probably\nwere the first Arthropoda to be evolved from some unknown annelid\nworm. They had jointed biramose limbs of nearly uniform shape and\nsize on each segment of the body, which were not, as in Crustacea,\ndifferentiated into antenn\u00e6, jaws (mandibles), maxill\u00e6, maxillipeds,\nand two kinds of legs (thoracic and abdominal), showing that they are a much more primitive type, and\nnearer to the annelids than any other\nArthropoda. Their gills, as shown by the\nresearches of Walcott and of Beecher,\nwere attached to nearly if not every pair\nof limbs behind the antenn\u00e6 (Figs. 1, 2).\nThe fact that in Trilobita the first pair of\nlimbs is antenniform does not prove that\nthey are Crustacea, since Eurypterus has\na similar pair of appendages.\nThe limbs in\ntrilobites, as well\nas the abdominal\nones of\nmerostomes, and\nall those of\nCrustacea, except\nthe first antenn\u00e6,\nare biramose,\nconsisting of an\nouter (exopodite)\nand an inner\ndivision\n(endopodite). In this respect the terrestrial air-breathing tracheate\nforms, Arachnida, Myriopoda, and Insecta, differ from the\nbranchiate forms, as their legs are single or undivided, being adapted\nfor supporting the body during locomotion upon the solid earth. It is\nto be observed that when, as in Limulus, the body is supported by\ncephalic ambulatory limbs, they are single, while the abdominal\nlimbs, used as they are in swimming, are biramose, much as in\nCrustacea.",
    "arachnida":"\nThe Arachnida.\u2014The scorpions and spiders are much less\nclosely allied to the myriopods and insects than formerly supposed.\nTheir embryology shows that they have descended from forms\nrelated to Limulus, possibly having had an origin in common with\nthat animal, or having, as some authors claim, directly diverged from\nsome primitive eurypteroid merostome. But they differ in essential\nrespects, and not only in the nature and grouping of their appendages; the first pair instead of antenniform being like\nmandibles, and the second pair like the maxill\u00e6, with the palps, of\ninsects, the four succeeding segments (thoracic) bearing each a pair\nof legs. They also have a brain quite unlike that of Limulus, the\nnervous cord behind the brain, however, being somewhat similar,\nthough that of Limulus differs in being enveloped by an arterial coat.\nArachnida respire by trache\u00e6, besides book-lungs, which, however,\nare possibly derivatives of the book-gills of Limulus, while they\nperform the office of excretion by means of the malpighian tubes,\nand like Limulus possess two large digestive glands (\u201cliver\u201d). Their\nembryos have, on at least six abdominal segments, rudiments of\nlimbs, three pairs of which form the spinnerets, showing their origin\nfrom Limulus-like or eurypteroid forms; their coxal glands are\nretained from their eurypteroid ancestors. The Arachnida probably\ndescended from marine merostomes, and not from an independent\nannelid ancestry, hence we have represented them in the diagram on\np. 3 as branching off from the merostomatous phylum, rather than\nfrom an independent one. The characters in which arachnids approach insects, such as\ntrache\u00e6 and malpighian tubes (none occur, as a rule, in marine or\nbranchiate arthropods), may be comparatively recent structures\nacquired during a change from a marine to a terrestrial life, and not\nprimitive heirlooms.\nArachnida also show their later origin than merostomes by the fact\nthat their sexual glands are in most cases single, and though with\nrare exceptions the ducts are paired, these finally unite and open\nexternally by a common single genital aperture in the median line of\nthe body, at the base of the abdomen (Fig. 3, C, D). In this respect\nLimulus, with its pair of genital male or female openings, situated\neach at the end of a papilla, placed widely apart at the base of the\nfirst abdominal limbs, is decidedly more archaic. Unlike Crustacea\nand insects, Arachnida do not, except in the mites (Acarina), which is\na very much modified group, undergo a metamorphosis.\nWe see, then, that the insects, with the Myriopoda, are somewhat\nisolated from the other Arthropoda. The Myriopoda have a single\npair of antenn\u00e6, and as they have other characters in common with\ninsects, Lang has united the two groups in a single class Antennata;\nbut, as we shall see, this seems somewhat premature and\nunnecessary. Yet the two groups have perhaps had a common\nparentage, and may prove to belong to a distinct, common phylum.\nNot only by their structure and embryology, as well as their\nmetamorphosis, do the myriopods and insects stand apart from the\nArachnida and other arthropods, but it seems probable that they\nhave had a different ancestry, the arthropods being apparently\npolyphyletic.\nThere are two animals which appear to connect the insects with\nthe worms, and which indicate a separate line of descent from the\nworms independent of that of the other classes. These are the\nsingular Peripatus, which serves as a connecting link between\narthropods and worms, and Scolopendrella (Symphyla). These two animals are guide-posts, pointing out, though vaguely to be sure, the\nway probably trod by the forms, now extinct, which led up to the\ninsects.",
    "peripatus":"\nRelations of Peripatus to Insects.\u2014We will first recount the\ncharacteristics of this monotypic class. Peripatus (Fig. 4) stands\nalone, with no forms intermediate between itself and the worms on\nthe one hand, and the true Arthropoda on the other. Originally\nsupposed to be a worm, it is now referred to a class by itself, the\nMalacopoda of Blainville, or Protracheata of Haeckel. It lives in the\ntropics, in damp places under decaying wood. In general appearance\nit somewhat resembles a caterpillar, but the head is soft and worm\u0002like, though it bears a pair of antenna-like tentacles. It may be said\nrather to superficially resemble a leech with clawed legs, the skin and\nits wrinkles being like those of a leech. There is a pair of horny jaws\nin the mouth, but these are more like the pharyngeal teeth of worms\nthan the jaws of arthropods. The numerous legs end each in a pair of\nclaws. The ladder-like nervous system is unlike that of annelid\nworms or arthropods, but rather recalls that of certain molluscs\n(Chiton, etc.), as well as that of certain flat and nemertine worms. Its\nannelid features are the large number of segmentally arranged true\nnephridia, and the nature of the integument. Its arthropodan\nfeatures, which appear to take it out of the group of worms, are the\npresence of trache\u00e6, of true salivary and slime glands, of a pair of\ncoxal glands (Fig. 4, C, cd) as well as the claws at the end of the legs.\nThe trache\u00e6, which are by no means the only arthropodan features,\nare evidently modified dermal glands. The heart is arthropodan,\nbeing a dorsal tube lying in a pericardial sinus, with many openings.\nThis assemblage of characters is not to be found in any marine or\nterrestrial worm.\nThe trache\u00e6 (Fig. 4, D, tr) are unbranched fine tubes, without a\n\u201cspiral thread,\u201d and are arranged in tufts, in P. edwardsii opening by\nsimple orifices or pores (\u201cstigmata\u201d) scattered irregularly over the\nsurface of the body; but in another species (P. capensis) some of the\nstigmata are arranged more definitely in longitudinal rows,\u2014on each\nside two, one dorsally and one ventrally. \u201cThe stigmata in a\nlongitudinal row are, however, more numerous than the pairs of\nlegs.\u201d (Lang.) The salivary glands, opening by a short common duct into the\nunder side of the mouth, in the same general position as in insects,\nare evidently, as the embryology of the animal proves, transformed\nnephridia, and being of the arthropodan type explain the origin and\nmorphology of those of insects. It is so with the slime glands; these,\nwith the coxal glands, being transformed and very large dermal\nglands. Those of insects arose in the same manner, and are evidently\ntheir homologues, while those of Peripatus were probably originally\nderived from the setiparous glands in the appendages (parapodia) of\nannelid worms. The genital glands and ducts are paired, but it is to be observed\nthat the outlets are single and situated at the end of the body. In the\nmale the ejaculatory duct is single; in its base a spermatophore is\nformed. It will be seen, then, that Peripatus is not only a composite\ntype, and a connecting link between worms and tracheate\narthropods, but that it may reasonably be regarded, if not itself the\nancestor, as resembling the probable progenitor of myriopods and\ninsects, though of course there is a very wide gap between Peripatus\nand the other antennate, air-breathing Arthropoda.",
    "myriopods": "Relation of Myriopods to Insects.\u2014The Myriopoda are the\nnearest allies of the insects. They have a distinct head, with one pair\nof antenn\u00e6. The eyes are simple, with the exception of a single genus\n(Cermatia), in which they are aggregated or compound. The trunk or\nbody behind the head is, as a rule, long and slender, and composed of\na large but variable number of segments, of equal size and shape,\nbearing jointed legs, which invariably end in a single claw.\nThe mouth-parts of the myriopods are so different in shape and\ngeneral function from those of insects, that this character, together\nwith the equally segmented nature of the portion of the body behind\nthe head (the trunk), forbids our merging them, as some have been\ninclined to do, with the insects. There are two sub-classes of\nmyriopods, differing in such important respects that by Pocock[1]\n and\nby Kingsley they are regarded as independent classes, each\nequivalent to the insects.\nOf these the most primitive are the Diplopoda (Chilognatha),\nrepresented by the galley-worms (Julus, etc.). In the typical Diplopoda the head consists of three\nsegments, a preoral or antennal, and two postoral, there\nbeing two pairs of jaw-like appendages, which, though in a\nbroad morphological sense homologues of the mandibles\nand first maxill\u00e6 of insects, are quite unlike them in\ndetails.\nAs we have previously stated,[2]\nthe so-called \u201cmandibles\u201d of\ndiplopods are entirely different\nfrom those of insects, since they\nappear to be 2\u2013 or 3\u2013jointed, the\nterminal joint being 2\u2013lobed, thus\nresembling the maxill\u00e6 rather than\nthe mandibles of insects, which\nconsist of but a single piece or joint,\nprobably the homologue of the\ngalea or molar joint of the diplopod\nprotomala. The mandible of the\nJulid\u00e6 (Fig. 5, Julus molybdinus),\nLysiopetalid\u00e6, and Polydesmid\u00e6\nconsists of three joints; viz. a basal piece or\ncardo, a stipes, and the mala mandibularis,\nwhich supports two lobes analogous to the\ngalea and lacinia of the maxilla of an insect.\nThere is an approach, as we shall see, in the\nmandible of Copris, to that of the Julid\u00e6, but in insects in general the\nlacinia is wanting, and the jaw consists of but a single piece.\nThe deutomal\u00e6 (gnathochilarium), or second pair of diplopod\njaws, are analogous to the labium or second maxill\u00e6 of insects,\nforming a flattened, plate-like under-lip, constituting the floor of the\nmouth (Fig. 6). This pair of appendages needs farther study,\nespecially in the late embryo, before it can be fully understood. So far\nas known, judging by Metschnikoff\u2019s work on the embryology of the\ndiplopods, these myriopods seem to have in the embryo but two\npairs of post-antennal mouth-parts, which he designated as the\n\u201cmandibles\u201d and \u201clabium.\u201d Meinert, however, regards as a third pair\nof mouth-parts or \u201clabium\u201d what in our Fig. 7 is called the internal stipes (stip. i.), behind which is a triangular plate, lamina labialis\n(lam. lab), which he regards as the sternite of the same segment.\nThe hypopharynx, our\n\u201clabiella,\u201d (Fig. 6), with the\nsupporting rods or stili linguales\n(sti. l), of Meinert, are of nearly\nthe same shape as in some\ninsects.\nOf the clypeus of insects there\nis apparently no homologue in\nmyriopods, though in certain\ndiplopods there is an interantennal clypeal region.\nThe labium of insects is represented by a short,\nbroad piece, which, however, unlike that of\ninsects, is immovable, and is flanked by a separate\npiece called the epilabrum (Fig. 8). Vom Rath has\nobserved an epipharynx, which has the same\ngeneral relations as in insects.\nThe embryology of myriopods is in many respects like that of\ninsects. The larva of diplopods hatches with but few segments, and\nwith but three pairs of limbs; but these are not, as in insects,\nappended to consecutive segments, but in one species the third, and\nin another, Julus multistriatus? (Fig. 10), the second, segment from\nthe head is footless, while Vom Rath represents the first segment of\nan European Blaniulus as footless, the feet being situated\nconsecutively on segments 2 to 4. The new segments arise at \u201cthe\ngrowing point\u201d situated between the last and penultimate segment,\ngrowing out in groups of sixes (Newport) or in our Julus\nmultistriatus? in fives (Fig. 10). In adult life diplopods (Julus) have a\nsingle pair of limbs on the three first segments, or those\ncorresponding to the thoracic segments of insects, the succeeding\nsegments having two pairs to each segment. Diplopods are also provided with\neversible coxal sacs, in position like\nthose of Symphyla and Synaptera;\nMeinert, Latzel, and also Haase\nhaving detected them in several\nspecies of Chordeumid\u00e6,\nLysiopetalid\u00e6, and Polyzonid\u00e6\n(Fig. 11). In Lysiopetalum anceps\nthese blood-gills occur in both\nsexes between the cox\u00e6 of the third\nto sixteenth pair of limbs. In the\nDiplopods the blood-gills appear to\nbe more or less permanently\neverted, while in Scolopendrella\nthey are usually retracted within\nthe body (Fig. 15, cg).\nDiplopods also differ externally\nfrom insects in the genital\narmature, a complicated apparatus of male claspers\nand hooks apparently arising from the sternum of the\nsixth segment and being the modified seventh pair of\nlegs. In myriopods there are no pleural pieces or\n\u201cpleurites,\u201d so characteristic of winged insects.\nPerhaps the most fundamental difference between\ndiplopods and insects is the fact that the paired\ngenital openings of the former are situated not far\nbehind the head between the second and third pair of\nlegs. Both the oviducts and male ejaculatory ducts are\npaired, with separate openings. The genital glands lie\nbeneath, while in chilopods they lie above the\nintestine; this, as Korschelt and Heider state, being a\nmore primitive relation, since in Peripatus they also lie above the\ndigestive canal.\nThe nervous system of diplopods is not only remarkable for the\nlack of the tendency towards a fusion of the ganglia observable in\ninsects, but for the fact that the double segments are each provided\n with two ganglia. The brain also is very small in proportion to the\nventral cord, the nervous system being in its general appearance\nsomewhat as in caterpillars.\nThe arrangement of the trache\u00e6 and stigmata is much as in\ninsects, but in the Diplopoda the tracheary system is more primitive\nthan in chilopods, a pair of stigmata and a pair of tracheal bundles\noccurring in each segment, while the bundles are not connected by\nanastomosing branches, branched trache\u00e6 only occurring in the\nGlomerid\u00e6. The trache\u00e6 themselves are without spiral threads\n(t\u00e6nidia). It is noteworthy that the trache\u00e6 arise much later than in\ninsects, not appearing until the animal is hatched; in this respect the\nmyriopods approximate Peripatus.\nIn the Chilopoda also the parts of the head, except the epicranium,\nare not homologous with those of insects, neither are the mouth\u0002parts, of which there are five pairs.\nThe structure of the head of centipedes is shown in part in Fig. 12,\ncompare also Fig. 8. It will be seen that it differs much from that of\nthe diplopods, though the mandibles (protomal\u00e6) are homologous;\nthey are divided into a cardo and stipes, thus being at least two\u0002jointed.\nThe second pair of postoral appendages is in centipedes very\ndifferent from the gnathochilarium of diplopods. As seen in Fig. 12 2,\nthey are separate, cylindrical, fleshy, five-jointed appendages, the\nmaxillary appendages of Newport, which are \u201cconnected transversely\nat their base with a pair of soft appendages\u201d (c), the lingua of\nNewport. The third and fourth pair are foot-jaws, and we have called\nthem malipedes, as they have of course no homology with the\nmaxillipedes of Crustacea. The second pair of these malipedes,\nforming the last pair of mouth-appendages, is the poison-fangs (4),\nwhich are intermediate between the malipedes and the feet; Meinert\ndoes not allow that these are mouth-appendages. The embryology of Geophilus by Metschnikoff shows plainly the\nfour pairs of post-antennal appendages. The embryo Geophilus is\nhatched in the form of the adult, having, unlike the diplopods, no\nmetamorphosis, its embryological history being condensed or\nabbreviated. But in examining Metschnikoff\u2019s figures certain\nprimitive diplopod features are revealed. The body of the embryo\nshortly before hatching is cylindrical; the sternal region is much\nnarrower than in the adult, hence the insertions of the feet are nearer\ntogether, while the first six pairs of appendages begin to grow out\nbefore the hinder ones. Thus the first six pairs of appendages of the\nembryo Geophilus correspond to the antenn\u00e6, two pairs of jaws, and\nthree pairs of legs of the larval Julus. These features appear to\nindicate that the chilopods may be an offshoot from the diplopod\nstem. The acquisition of a second pair of legs to a segment in\ndiplopods, as in the phyllopod Crustacea, is clearly enough a\nsecondary character, as shown by the figures of Newport in his\nmemoir on the development of the Myriopoda (Pl. IV.). Thus the\ntendency in the Myriopoda, both diplopods and chilopods, is towards\nthe multiplication of segments and the elongation of the body, while in insects the polypodous embryo has the three terminal segments of\nthe abdomen well formed, these being, however, before hatching,\npartly atrophied, so that the body of insects after birth tends to\nbecome shortened or condensed. This indicates the descent of insects\nfrom ancestors with elongated polypodous hind-bodies like\nScolopendrella. Korschelt and Heider suggest that the stem-form of\nmyriopods was a homonomously jointed form like Peripatus,\nconsisting of a rather large number of segments, but we might, with\nHaase, consider that the great number of segments which we now\nfind indicates a late acquisition of this form.\nThe genital opening in chilopods is single, and situated in the\npenultimate segment of the body, as in insects. While recognizing the\nclose relationship of the Myriopoda with the insects, it still seems\nadvisable not to unite them into a single group (as Oudemans, Lang,\nand others would do), but to regard them as forming an equivalent\nclass. On the other hand, when we take into account the form and\nstructure of the head, antenn\u00e6, and especially the shape of the first\npair of mouth-appendages, being at least two-jointed in both groups,\nwe think these characters, with the homonomously segmented body\nbehind the head, outweigh the difference in the position of the\ngenital outlet, important as that may seem. It should also be taken\ninto account that while insects are derived from polypodous\nancestors, no one supposes, with the exception of one or two authors,\nthat these ancestors are the Myriopoda, the latter having evidently\ndescended from a six-legged ancestor, quite different from that of the\nCampodea ancestor of insects.[4]\nIn regard to the sexual openings of worms, though their position is\nin general in the anterior part of the body, it is still very variable,\nthough, in general, paired. In the oligochete worms the genital zone,\nwith the external openings, is formed by the segments lying between\nthe 9th and 14th rings, though in some the genital organs are\nsituated still nearer the head. The myriopods, which evolved from\nthe worms earlier than insects, appear to have in their most primitive\nforms (the Diplopoda) retained this vermian position of the genital\noutlets. In the later forms, the chilopods, the genital openings have\nbeen carried back to near the end of the body, as in insects. From\nobservations made by three different observers on the freshly\nhatched larva of the Julid\u00e6, it appears that the ancestral diplopods were six-footed, or oligopod, the larva of Pauropus (Fig. 13)\napproaching nearest to our idea of the ancestral myriopod, which\nmight provisionally be named Protopauropus.",
    "symphyla":"\nRelations of the Symphyla to Insects.\u2014Opinions respecting\nthe position of the Symphyla, represented by Scolopendrella (Fig.\n14), are very discordant. By most writers since Newport,\nScolopendrella has been placed among the myriopods. The first\nauthor, however, to examine its internal anatomy was Menge (1851),\nwho discovered among other structures (trache\u00e6, etc.) the silk\u0002glands situated in the last two segments, and which open at the end\nof each cercus. He regarded the form as \u201cthe type of a genus or family\nintermediate between the hexapod Lepismid\u00e6 and the\nScolopendrid\u00e6.\u201d In 1873[5]\nthe writer referred to this form as follows: \u201cIt may be\nregarded as a connecting link between the Thysanura and\nMyriopoda, and shows the intimate relation of the myriopods and\nthe hexapods, perhaps not sufficiently appreciated by many\nzo\u00f6logists.\u201d\nIn 1880 Ryder regarded it as \u201cthe last survival of the form from\nwhich insects may be supposed to have descended,\u201d and referred it to\n\u201cthe new ordinal group Symphyla, in reference to the singular\ncombination of myriopodous, insectean, and thysanurous characters\nwhich it presents.[6]\u201d Wood-Mason considered it to be a myriopod, and \u201cthe descendant\nof a group of myriopods from which the Campode\u00e6, Thysanura, and\nCollembola may have sprung.\u201d We are indebted to Grassi for the first\nextended work on the morphology of Scolopendrella (1885). In 1886\nhe added to our knowledge facts regarding the internal anatomy, and\ngives a detailed comparison with the Thysanura, besides pointing out\nthe resemblances of Scolopendrella to Pauropus, diplopods,\nchilopods, as well as Peripatus. In 1888 Grassi expressed his view as to the position of the\nSymphyla, stating that it should not be included in the Thysanura,\nsince it evidently has myriopod characters; these being the\nsupraspinal vessel, the ventral position of the genital glands; the\nsituation of the genital opening in the fourth segment of the trunk,\nits ganglionic chain being like that of diplopods, its having limbs on\nall the segments, etc. On the other hand, Grassi has with much detail\nindicated the points of resemblance to the Thysanura. The principal\nones are the thin integument, the want of sympathetic ganglia, the\npresence of a pair of cephalic stigmata, like that said to occur in\ncertain Collembola, and in the embryo of Apis; two endoskeletal\nprocesses situated near the ventral fascia of the head; the epicranial\nsuture also occurring in Thysanura, Collembola, Orthoptera, and\nother winged insects, and being absent in diplopods and chilopods.\nHe also adds that the digestive canal both in Symphyla and\nThysanura is divided into three portions; the malpighian tubes in\nThysanura present very different conditions (there being none in\nJapyx), among which may be comprised those of Scolopendrella. In\nboth groups there is a single pair of salivary glands. The cellular\nepithelium of the mid-intestine of Scolopendrella is of a single form\nas in Campodea and Japyx. The fat-body, dorsal vessel, with its\nvalves and ostia, are alike in the two groups, as are the appendages of\nthe end of the abdomen, the anal cerci (cercopoda) of Scolopendrella\nbeing the homologues of the multiarticulate appendages of Lepisma,\netc., and of the forceps of Japyx. In those of Scolopendrella, we have\nfound the large duct leading from the voluminous silk-gland, a single large sac extending forwards into the third segment from the end of\nthe body (Fig. 15, s. gl). Other points of resemblance, all of which he\nenumerates, are the slight differences in the number of trunk\u0002segments, the presence in the two groups of the abdominal \u201cfalse\u0002legs\u201d (parapodia), the dorsal plate, and the mouth-parts. As regards\nthe latter, Grassi affirms that there is a perfect parallelism between\nthose of Scolopendrella and Thysanura. To this point we will return\nagain in treating more especially of those of the Symphyla. Finally,\nGrassi concludes that there is \u201ca great resemblance between the\nThysanura and Scolopendrella.\u201d He, however, believed that the\nSymphyla are the forerunners of the myriopods, and not of the\ninsects, his genealogical tree representing the symphylan and\nthysanuran phyla as originating from the same point, this point also\nbeing, rather strangely, the point of origin of the arachnidan phylum.\nHaase (1889) regarded Scolopendrella as a myriopod, and Pocock\n(1893) assigned the Symphyla to an independent class, regarding\nScolopendrella as \u201cthe living form that comes nearest to the\nhypothetical ancestor of the two great divisions of tracheates.\u201d\nSchmidt\u2019s work (1895) on the morphology of this genus is more\nextended and richly illustrated than Grassi\u2019s, his method of research\nbeing more modern. He also regards this form as one of the lower\nmyriopods.\nIn conclusion, it appears to us that, on the whole, if we throw out\nthe single characteristic of the anteriorly situated genital opening,\nthe ovarian tubes being directed toward the end of the body (Fig. 15,\novd, ov), there is not sufficient reason for placing the Symphyla\namong the Myriopoda, either below or near the diplopods. This is the\nonly valid reason for not regarding Scolopendrella as the\nrepresentative of a group from which the insects have descended,\nand which partly fills the wide abyss between Peripatus and insects.\nWith the view of Pocock, that both insects and myriopods have\ndescended from Scolopendrella, we do not agree, because this form\nhas so many insectean features, and a single unpaired genital\nopening. For the same reason we should not agree with Schmidt in\ninterpolating the Symphyla between the Pauropoda and Diplopoda.\nIn these last two progoneate groups the genital openings are paired,\nhence they are much more primitive types than Scolopendrella, in\nwhich there is but a single opening. It seems most probable that the Symphyla, though progoneate, are more recent forms than the\nprogoneate myriopods, which have retained the primitive feature of\ndouble sexual outlets. It is more probable that the Symphyla were the\ndescendants of these polypodous forms. Certainly Scolopendrella is\nthe only extant arthropod which, with the sole exception of the\nanteriorly situated genital opening, fulfils the conditions required of\nan ancestor of Thysanura, and through them of the winged insects.\nNo one has been so bold as to suggest the derivation of insects from\neither diplopods or chilopods, while their origin from a form similar\nto Scolopendrella seems not improbable. Yet Uzel has very recently\ndiscovered that Campodea develops in some respects like Geophilus,\nthe primitive band sinking in its middle into the yolk, with other\nfeatures as in chilopods.[7] The retention of a double sexual opening\nin the diplopods is paralleled by the case of Limulus with its double\nor paired sexual outlets, opening in a pair of papill\u00e6, as compared\nwith what are regarded as the generalized or more primitive\nCrustacea, which have an unpaired sexual opening.",
    "symphylacharacter": "\nDiagnostic or essential characters of Symphyla.\u2014Head\nshaped as in Thysanura (Cinura), with the Y-shaped tergal suture,\nwhich occurs commonly in insects (Thysanura, Collembola,\nDermaptera, Orthoptera, Platyptera, Neuroptera, etc.), but is\nwanting in Myriopoda (Diplopoda and Chilopoda); antenn\u00e6[8]\nunlike those of Myriopoda in being very long, slender, and\nmoniliform. Clypeus distinct. Labrum emarginate, with six\nconverging teeth. Mandibles 2\u2013jointed, consisting of a vestigial\nstipes and distal or molar joint, the latter with eight teeth. First\nmaxill\u00e6 with an outer and inner mala situated on a well-developed\nstipes; with a minute, 1\u2013jointed palpus. Second pair of maxill\u00e6:\neach forming two oblong flat pieces, median sutures distinct, with\nno palpi; these pieces are toothed in front, and appear to be\nhomologous with the two median pieces of the gnathochilarium of\nDiplopoda. Hypopharynx? Epipharynx?\nTrunk with from fifteen to sixteen dorsal, more or less free\nsubequal scutes, the first the smallest. Pedigerous segments twelve;\nalso twelve pairs of 5\u2013jointed legs, which are of nearly equal length, the first pair 4\u2013, the others 5\u2013jointed, all ending in two claws, as in\nSynaptera and winged insects. A pair of 1\u2013jointed anal cerci\nhomologous with those of Thysanura and Orthoptera, into each of\nwhich opens a large abdominal silk-gland. Abdominal segments\nwith movable styles or \u201cpseudopods\u201d (\u201cParapodia\u201d of Latzel and of\nSchmidt), like those of Campodea and Machilis, and situated on the\nbase of the coxal joint in front of the ventral sac. Within the body\nnear the base of each abdominal style is an eversible coxal sac or\nblood-gill (Fig. 15, cg). The single genital opening is on the fourth\ntrunk-segment in both sexes (Fig. 15, indicated by the arrow). The\nmalpighian tubes (ur. t) are two in number, opening into the\ndigestive canal at the anterior end of the hind intestine; they extend\nin front to the third or second segment from the head. They are\nbroad and straight at their origin, becoming towards the end very\nslender and convoluted.\nThe three divisions of the digestive tract are as in insects, the\nepithelium of the mid-gut being histologically as in Campodea and\nJapyx; rectal glands are present. A pair of very large salivary\nglands are situated in the first to the fourth trunk-segments,\nconsisting of a glandular portion with its duct, which unite into a\ncommon duct opening on the under side of the head, probably in the\nlabium.\nBut a single pair of stigmata is present, and these are situated in\nthe front of the head, beneath the insertion of the antenn\u00e6 and\nwithin the stipes of the mandibles; the trache\u00e6 are very fine,\nwithout spiral threads (t\u00e6nidia), and mostly contained within the\nhead, two fine branches extending on each side into the second\ntrunk-segment.\nAfter birth the body increases in length by the addition of new\nsegments at the growing point.\nIn respect to the nervous system, there are no diagnostic\ncharacters; there are, however, not as many as two pairs of ganglia to\na segment. The brain is well developed, sending a pair of slender\nnerves to the small eyes. The ganglia of the segment bearing the first\npair of legs is fused with the sub\u0153sophageal ganglion. Grassi was\nunable to detect a true sympathetic system, but he suspects the\nexistence of a very small frontal ganglion. The slender dorsal vessel, provided with ostia and valvules,\npulsates along the entire length of the trunk; an aorta passes into the\nhead.\nThe internal genital organs of both sexes are paired, and extend\nalong the greater part of the trunk; in either sex they may be\ncompared to two long, slender, straight cords extending from the\nfourth to the tenth pair of legs. The two oviducts do not unite before\nreaching the sexual opening (Fig. 15, ovd).\nThe male sexual organs are more complicated than the feminine.\nThe paired testicular tubes lie in trunk-segments 6 to 12, on each\nside, and partly under the intestinal canal, communicating with each\nother by a cross-anastomosis situated under the intestine, and which,\nlike the testes, is filled with sperm. Of the paired seminal ducts (vas\ndeferens) in trunk-segment 4, each unites again into a thick tube,\nsending a blind tube forward into the third segment. Under the place\nof union of the two vasa deferentia arise the paired ductus\nejaculatorii, which open beneath in the uterus masculinus. The\nanterior blind ends of the vasa deferentia form a sort of small paired\nvesicul\u00e6 seminales in which a great quantity of ripe sperm is stored.\nThe uterus masculinus is in its structure homologous with the\nevaginable penis of Pauropus, Polyxenus, and some diplopods, and\nthe sexual opening has without doubt become secondarily unpaired.\nThe sexual opening is rather long and is closed by two longitudinal\nfolds. \u201cIn several respects the male sexual organs of Scolopendrella\nare like those of Pauropus; in the last-named form we have indeed an\nunpaired testis, but also in Scolopendrella we see the beginning of\nsuch a singleness; namely, the presence of an anastomosis uniting\nthe two tubes, their communication by means of a transverse\nconnecting canal and a glandular structure in the epithelium forming\nthem. The male sexual organs of Pauropus differ only through a still\ngreater complication.\u201d (Schmidt.)\nScolopendrella in habits resembles chilopods, being found in\ncompany with Geophilus burrowing deep in light sand under leaves,\nor living at the surface of the ground under sticks or stones. It is very\nagile in its movements, and is probably carnivorous. It was\nconsidered by Haase to be eyeless, but the presence of two ocelli has\nbeen demonstrated both by Grassi and by Schmidt. Whether the\npigment and corneous facet are present is not certain. The embryology is entirely unknown (although Henshaw reports finding\na hexapodous young one), and it need not be said that a knowledge\nof it is a very great desideratum. It is most probable that the young is\nhexapodous, since the first pair of limbs are 4\u2013jointed, all the rest 5\u2013\njointed; while Newport, and also Ryder, observed specimens with\nnine, ten, eleven, and twelve pairs, and Wood-Mason confirms their\nobservations, \u201cwhich prove that a pair of legs is added at each\nmoult,\u201d and he concludes that the addition of new segments\n\u201ctherefore takes place in this animal by the intercalation of two at\neach moult between the antepenultimate and penultimate sterna, as\nin the Chilognatha, and as also in some of the Chilopoda.\u201d\nThere is but one family, Scolopendrellid\u00e6, and a single genus,\nScolopendrella, which seems to be, like other archaic types,\ncosmopolitan in its distribution."
