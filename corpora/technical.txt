<p class='c006'>In preparing this book the author had in mind the wants both of
the student and the teacher. For the student’s use the more difficult
portions, particularly that on the embryology, may be omitted.
The work has grown in part out of the writer’s experience in class
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In instructing small classes in the anatomy and metamorphoses
of insects, it was strongly felt that the mere dissection and drawing
of a few types, comprising some of our common insects, were by no
means sufficient for broad, thorough work. Plainly enough the
laboratory work is all important, being rigidly disciplinary in its
methods, and affording the foundation for any farther work. But
to this should be added frequent explanations or formal lectures,
and the student should be required to do collateral reading in some
general work on structural and developmental entomology. With
this aim in view, the present work has been prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be said in explanation of the plan of this book, that the
students having previously taken a lecture course in the zoölogy of
the invertebrates, were first instructed in the facts and conclusions
bearing on the relations of insects to other Arthropoda, and more
especially the anatomy of Peripatus, of the Myriopoda, and of Scolopendrella.
Then the structure of Campodea, Machilis, and Lepisma
was described, after which a few types of winged insects, beginning
with the locust and ending with the bee, were drawn and dissected;
the nymph of the locust, and the larva and pupa of a moth and of
a wasp and bee being drawn and examined. Had time permitted,
an outline of the embryology and of the internal changes in flies
during their metamorphoses would have been added.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>This book gives, of course with much greater fulness and detail
for reference and collateral reading, what we roughly outlined in
our class work. The aim has been to afford a broad foundation for
future more special work by any one who may want to carry on the
study of some group of insects, or to extend in any special direction
our present knowledge of insect morphology and growth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many of our entomologists begin their studies without any previous
knowledge of the structure of animals, taking it up as an
amusement. They may be mere collectors and satisfied simply to
know the name of their captures, but it is hoped that with this
book in their hands they may be led to desire farther information
regarding what has already been done on the structure and mode of
growth of the common insects. For practical details as to how to
dissect, to make microscopic slides, and to mount and preserve
insects generally, they are referred to the author’s “Entomology for
Beginners.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It may also be acknowledged that even in our best and latest
general treatises on zoölogy, or comparative anatomy, or morphology,
the portion related to insects is scarcely so thoroughly done as those
parts devoted to other phyla, that of Lang, however, his invaluable
Comparative Anatomy, being an exception. On this account, therefore,
it is hoped that this hiatus in our literature may be in a degree
filled.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has made free use of the excellent article “Insecta”
of Newport, of Lang’s comprehensive summary in his most useful
Text-book of Comparative Anatomy, of Graber’s excellent Die
Insecten, of Miall and Denny’s The Structure and Life-History of
the Cockroach, and of Sharp’s Insecta. Kolbe’s Einführung has
been most helpful. But besides these helps, liberal use has been
made of the very numerous memoirs and monographic articles
which adorn our entomological literature. The account of the
embryology of insects is based on Korschelt and Heider’s elaborate
work, Lehrbuch der Vergleichenden Entwicklungsgeschichte der
Wirbellosen Thiere, the illustrations of this portion being mainly
taken from it, through the Messrs. Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co.,
London.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Professor H. S. Pratt has kindly read over the manuscript and also
the proofs of the portion on embryology and metamorphoses, and
the author is happy to acknowledge the essential service he has
rendered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bibliographical lists are arranged by dates, so as to give an
idea of the historical development of each subject. The aim has
been to make these lists tolerably complete and to include the
earliest, almost forgotten works and articles as well as the most
recent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much care has been taken to give due credit either to the original
sources from which the illustrations are copied, or to the artist;
about ninety of the simpler figures were drawn by the author, many
of them for this work. For the use of certain figures acknowledgments
are due to the Boston Society of Natural History, to the
Division of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture, through
the kind offices of Mr. L. O. Howard, and to the Illinois State
Laboratory of Natural History, through Professor S. A. Forbes and
Mr. C. A. Hart. Professor W. M. Wheeler, of the University of
Chicago, has kindly loaned for reproduction several of his original
drawings published in the Journal of Morphology. A number are
reproduced from figures in the reports of the United States Entomological
Commission.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>POSITION OF INSECTS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM</h3>
<p class='c006'>Although the insects form but a single class of the animal kingdom,
they are yet so numerous in orders, families, genera, and
species, their habits and transformations are so full of instruction
to the biologist, and they affect human interests in such a variety of
ways, that they have always attracted more attention from students
than any other class of animals, the number of entomologists greatly
surpassing that of ornithologists, ichthyologists, or the special students
of any other class, while the literature has assumed immense
proportions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insects form about four-fifths of the animal kingdom. There are
about 250,000 species already named and contained in our museums,
while the number of living and fossil species in all is estimated to
amount to between one and two millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their structure insects are perhaps more complicated than any
other animals. This is partly due to the serial arrangement of the
segments and the consequent segmental repetition of organs, especially
of the external appendages, and of the muscles, the tracheæ,
and the nerves. The brain is nearly or quite as complicated as that
of the higher vertebrates, while the sense-organs, especially those of
touch, sight, and smell are, as a rule, far more numerous and only
less complex than those of vertebrates. Moreover, in their psychical
development, certain insects are equal, or even superior, to any other
animals, except birds and mammals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The animal kingdom is primarily divided into two grand divisions,
the one-celled (<i>Protozoa</i>) and many-celled animals (<i>Metazoa</i>). In the
latter group the cells and tissues forming the body are arranged in
three fundamental cell-layers; viz. the <i>ectoderm</i> or outer layer, the
<i>mesoderm</i>, and <i>endoderm</i>. The series of branches, or phyla, comprised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>under the term Metazoa are the Porifera, Cœlenterata, Vermes,
Echinodermata, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata. Their approximate
relationships may be provisionally expressed by the following</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c002'>RELATIONS OF INSECTS TO OTHER ARTHROPODA</h3>
<p class='c006'>The insects by general consent stand at the head of the Arthropoda.
Their bodies are quite as much complicated or specialized,
and indeed, when we consider the winged forms, more so, than any
other class of the branch, and besides this they have wings, fitting
them for an aërial life. It is with little doubt that to their power of
flight, and thus of escaping the attacks of their creeping arthropod
enemies, insects owe, so to speak, their success in life; <i>i.e.</i> their
numerical superiority in individuals, species, and genera. It is also
apparently their power of moving or swimming swiftly from one
place to another which has led to the numerical superiority in species
of fishes to other Vertebrata. Among terrestrial vertebrates, the
birds, by virtue of their ability to fly, greatly surpass in number of
species the reptiles and mammals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Arthropoda are in general characterized by having the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>composed of segments (somites or arthromeres) bearing jointed appendages.
They differ from the worms in having segmented appendages,
<i>i.e.</i> antennæ, jaws, and legs, instead of the soft unjointed
outgrowths of the annelid worms. Moreover, their bodies are composed
of a more or less definite number of segments or rings, grouped
either into a head-thorax (cephalothorax) and hind-body, as in Crustacea,
or into a head differentiated from the rest of the body (trunk),
the latter not being divided into a distinct thorax and abdomen, as in
Myriopoda; or into three usually quite distinct regions—the head,
thorax, and hind-body or abdomen, as in insects. In certain aberrant,
modified forms, as the Tardigrada, or the Pantopoda, and the mites,
the body is not differentiated into such definite regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their internal organs arthropods agree in their general relations
with the higher worms, hence most zoölogists agree that they have
directly originated from the annelid worms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position and general shape of the digestive canal, of the
nervous and circulatory systems, are the same in Arthropoda as in
annelid (oligochete) worms, so much so that it is generally thought
that the Arthropoda are the direct descendants of the worms. It is
becoming evident, however, that there was no common ancestor of
the Arthropoda as a whole, and that the group is a polyphyletic one.
Hence, though a convenient group, it is a somewhat artificial one,
and may eventually be dismembered into at least three or four phyla
or branches.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following diagram may serve to show in a tentative way the
relations of the classes of Arthropoda to each other, and also may be
regarded as a provisional genealogical tree of the branch.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>We will now rapidly review the leading features of the classes of
Arthropoda.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Crustacea.</b>—These Arthropoda are in many most important
characteristics unlike the insects; they have two pairs of antennæ,
five pairs of buccal appendages, and they are branchiate Arthropoda.
They have evidently originated entirely independently, and by a
direct line of descent from some unknown annelid ancestor which
was either a many-segmented worm, with parapodia, or the two
groups together with the Rotifera may have originated from a common
appendigerous Trochosphæra. Their segments in the higher
forms are definite in number (23 or 24) and arranged into two
regions, a head-thorax (cephalothorax) and hind-body (abdomen).
Nearly all the segments, both of the cephalothorax and abdomen,
bear a pair of jointed limbs, and to them at their base are, in the
higher forms, appended the gills (branchiæ). The limbs are in the
more specialized forms (shrimps and crabs) differentiated into eye-stalks,
two pairs of antennæ, a pair of palpus-bearing jaws (mandibles),
two pairs of maxillæ and three pairs of maxillipeds; these
appendages being biramose, and the latter bearing gills attached to
their basal joints. The legs are further differentiated into ambulatory
thoracic legs and into swimming or abdominal legs, and in the
latter the first pair of the male is modified into copulatory organs
(gonopoda). The male and female reproductive organs as a rule are
in separate individuals, hermaphrodites being very unusual, and
the glands may be paired or single. The sexual outlets are generally
paired, and, as in the male lobster and other Macrura, open in
the basal joint of the last pair of legs, and in the female in the
third from the last; while originally in all Crustacea the sexual
organs were most probably paired (Fig. 3, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>They are, except a few land Isopoda, aquatic, mostly marine, and
when they have a metamorphosis, pass through a six-legged larval
stage, called the Nauplius, the shrimps and crabs passing through an
additional stage, the Zoëa. Crustacea also differ much from insects
in the highly modified nature of the nephridia, which are usually
represented by the green gland of the lobster, or the shell-glands of
the Phyllopoda, which open out in one of the head-segments; also in
the possession of a pair of large digestive glands, the so-called liver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Intermediate in some respects between the Crustacea and insects,
but more primitive, in respect to what are perhaps the most weighty
characters, than the Crustacea, are the Trilobita, the Merostomata
(Limulus), and, finally, the Arachnida, these being allied groups. In
the Trilobita and Merostomata (Limulus), the head-appendages are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>more like feet than jaws, while they have in most respects a similar
mode of embryonic development, the larval forms being also similar.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The Merostomata.</b>—The only living form, Limulus, is undoubtedly
a very primitive type, as the genital glands and ducts are double,
opening wide apart on the basal pair of abdominal legs (Fig. 3).
Moreover, their head-appendages, which are single, with spines on
the basal joint, are very primitive and morphologically nearer in
shape to those of the
worms (Syllidæ, etc.)
than even those of the
Crustacea. Besides,
their four pairs of coxal
glands, with an external
opening at the base of
the fifth pair of head-appendages,
and which
probably are modified
nephridia (Crustacea
having but a single pair
in any one form, either
opening out on the
second antennal, green
gland, or second maxillary,
shell-gland, segment),
indicate a closer
approximation to the
polynephrous worms.
Limulus has other archaic
features, especially
as regards the
structure of the simple
and compound eyes and
the simple nature of the
brain.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Trilobita.</b>—These
archaic forms are still
more generalized and primitive than the Merostomata and Crustacea,
and probably were the first Arthropoda to be evolved from
some unknown annelid worm. They had jointed biramose limbs of
nearly uniform shape and size on each segment of the body, which
were not, as in Crustacea, differentiated into antennæ, jaws (mandibles),
maxillæ, maxillipeds, and two kinds of legs (thoracic and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>abdominal), showing that they are a much more primitive type, and
nearer to the annelids than any other Arthropoda. Their gills, as
shown by the researches of Walcott
and of Beecher, were attached
to nearly if not every
pair of limbs behind the antennæ
(Figs. 1, 2). The fact that in
Trilobita the first pair of limbs
is antenniform does not prove
that they are Crustacea, since
Eurypterus has a similar pair
of appendages.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The limbs in trilobites, as well
as the abdominal ones of merostomes, and all those of Crustacea,
except the first antennæ, are biramose, consisting of an outer (exopodite)
and an inner division (endopodite). In this respect the terrestrial
air-breathing tracheate forms, Arachnida, Myriopoda, and
Insecta, differ from the branchiate forms, as their legs are single or
undivided, being adapted for supporting the body during locomotion
upon the solid earth. It is to be observed that when, as in Limulus,
the body is supported by cephalic ambulatory limbs, they are single,
while the abdominal limbs, used as they are in swimming, are
biramose, much as in Crustacea.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Arachnida.</b>—The scorpions and spiders are much less closely
allied to the myriopods and insects than formerly supposed. Their
embryology shows that they have descended from forms related to
Limulus, possibly having had an origin in common with that animal,
or having, as some authors claim, directly diverged from some
primitive eurypteroid merostome. But they differ in essential
respects, and not only in the nature and grouping of their appendages;
the first pair instead of antenniform being like mandibles,
and the second pair like the maxillæ, with the palps, of insects, the
four succeeding segments (thoracic) bearing each a pair of legs.
They also have a brain quite unlike that of Limulus, the nervous
cord behind the brain, however, being somewhat similar, though
that of Limulus differs in being enveloped by an arterial coat.
Arachnida respire by tracheæ, besides book-lungs, which, however,
are possibly derivatives of the book-gills of Limulus, while they
perform the office of excretion by means of the malpighian tubes,
and like Limulus possess two large digestive glands (“liver”).
Their embryos have, on at least six abdominal segments, rudiments
of limbs, three pairs of which form the spinnerets, showing their
origin from Limulus-like or eurypteroid forms; their coxal glands
are retained from their eurypteroid ancestors. The Arachnida probably
descended from marine merostomes, and not from an independent
annelid ancestry, hence we have represented them in the diagram
on p. <a href='#Page_3'>3</a> as branching off from the merostomatous phylum, rather
than from an independent one.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The characters in which arachnids approach insects, such as
tracheæ and malpighian tubes (none occur, as a rule, in marine or
branchiate arthropods), may be comparatively recent structures
acquired during a change from a marine to a terrestrial life, and
not primitive heirlooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arachnida also show their later origin than merostomes by the
fact that their sexual glands are in most cases single, and though
with rare exceptions the ducts are paired, these finally unite and
open externally by a common single genital aperture in the median
line of the body, at the base of the abdomen (Fig. 3, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>). In this
respect Limulus, with its pair of genital male or female openings,
situated each at the end of a papilla, placed widely apart at the base
of the first abdominal limbs, is decidedly more archaic. Unlike
Crustacea and insects, Arachnida do not, except in the mites
(Acarina), which is a very much modified group, undergo a metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see, then, that the insects, with the Myriopoda, are somewhat
isolated from the other Arthropoda. The Myriopoda have a single
pair of antennæ, and as they have other characters in common with
insects, Lang has united the two groups in a single class <i>Antennata</i>;
but, as we shall see, this seems somewhat premature and unnecessary.
Yet the two groups have perhaps had a common parentage, and may
prove to belong to a distinct, common phylum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only by their structure and embryology, as well as their
metamorphosis, do the myriopods and insects stand apart from the
Arachnida and other arthropods, but it seems probable that they
have had a different ancestry, the arthropods being apparently
polyphyletic.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two animals which appear to connect the insects with
the worms, and which indicate a separate line of descent from the
worms independent of that of the other classes. These are the
singular Peripatus, which serves as a connecting link between
arthropods and worms, and Scolopendrella (Symphyla). These
two animals are guide-posts, pointing out, though vaguely to be
sure, the way probably trod by the forms, now extinct, which led
up to the insects.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><b>Relations of Peripatus to Insects.</b>—We will first recount the characteristics
of this monotypic class. Peripatus (Fig. 4) stands alone,
with no forms intermediate between itself and the worms on the one
hand, and the true Arthropoda on the other. Originally supposed to
be a worm, it is now referred to a class by itself, the Malacopoda of
Blainville, or Protracheata of Haeckel. It lives in the tropics, in
damp places under decaying wood. In general appearance it somewhat
resembles a caterpillar, but the head is soft and worm-like,
though it bears a pair of antenna-like tentacles. It may be said
rather to superficially resemble a leech with clawed legs, the skin
and its wrinkles being like those of a leech. There is a pair of
horny jaws in the mouth, but these are more like the pharyngeal
teeth of worms than the jaws of arthropods. The numerous legs
end each in a pair of claws. The ladder-like nervous system is
unlike that of annelid worms or arthropods, but rather recalls that
of certain molluscs (Chiton, etc.), as well as that of certain flat and
nemertine worms. Its annelid features are the large number of
segmentally arranged true nephridia, and the nature of the integument.
Its arthropodan features, which appear to take it out of the
group of worms, are the presence of tracheæ, of true salivary and
slime glands, of a pair of coxal glands (Fig. 4, <i>C</i>, <i>cd</i>) as well as the
claws at the end of the legs. The tracheæ, which are by no means
the only arthropodan features, are evidently modified dermal glands.
The heart is arthropodan, being a dorsal tube lying in a pericardial
sinus, with many openings. This assemblage of characters is not
to be found in any marine or terrestrial worm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tracheæ (Fig. 4, <i>D</i>, <i>tr</i>) are unbranched fine tubes, without a
“spiral thread,” and are arranged in tufts, in <i>P. edwardsii</i> opening
by simple orifices or pores (“stigmata”) scattered irregularly over
the surface of the body; but in another species (<i>P. capensis</i>) some
of the stigmata are arranged more definitely in longitudinal rows,—on
each side two, one dorsally and one ventrally. “The stigmata
in a longitudinal row are, however, more numerous than the pairs
of legs.” (Lang.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The salivary glands, opening by a short common duct into the
under side of the mouth, in the same general position as in insects,
are evidently, as the embryology of the animal proves, transformed
nephridia, and being of the arthropodan type explain the origin and
morphology of those of insects. It is so with the slime glands; these,
with the coxal glands, being transformed and very large dermal
glands. Those of insects arose in the same manner, and are evidently
their homologues, while those of Peripatus were probably
originally derived from the setiparous glands in the appendages
(parapodia) of annelid worms.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The genital glands and ducts are paired, but it is to be observed
that the outlets are single and situated at the end of the body. In
the male the ejaculatory duct is single; in its base a spermatophore
is formed. It will be seen, then, that Peripatus is not only a composite
type, and a connecting link between worms and tracheate
arthropods, but that it may reasonably be regarded, if not itself
the ancestor, as resembling the probable progenitor of myriopods
and insects, though of course there is a very wide gap between
Peripatus and the other antennate, air-breathing Arthropoda.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Relation of Myriopods to Insects.</b>—The Myriopoda are the nearest
allies of the insects. They have a distinct head, with one pair of
antennæ. The eyes are simple, with the exception of a single genus
(Cermatia), in which they are aggregated or compound. The trunk
or body behind the head is, as a rule, long and slender, and composed
of a large but variable number of segments, of equal size and
shape, bearing jointed legs, which invariably end in a single claw.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mouth-parts of the myriopods are so different in shape and
general function from those of insects, that this character, together
with the equally segmented nature of the portion of the body behind
the head (the trunk), forbids our merging them, as some have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>inclined to do, with the insects. There are two sub-classes of
myriopods, differing in such important respects that by Pocock<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
by Kingsley they are regarded as independent classes, each equivalent
to the insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these the most primitive are the Diplopoda (Chilognatha),
represented by the galley-worms (Julus, etc.).</p>

<div  class='figleft id009'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the typical Diplopoda the head consists of
three segments, a preoral or antennal, and two postoral,
there being two pairs of jaw-like appendages,
which, though in a broad morphological sense homologues
of the mandibles and first maxillæ of insects,
are quite unlike them in details.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As we have previously stated,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> the so-called
“mandibles” of diplopods are entirely different
from those of insects, since they appear to be 2–
or 3–jointed, the terminal joint being 2–lobed, thus
resembling the maxillæ rather than the mandibles
of insects, which consist of but a single piece or
joint, probably the homologue of the galea or molar
joint of the diplopod protomala. The mandible of
the Julidæ (Fig. 5, <i>Julus
molybdinus</i>), Lysiopetalidæ,
and Polydesmidæ consists of
three joints; viz. a basal piece
or cardo, a stipes, and the <i>mala
mandibularis</i>, which supports
two lobes analogous to the
galea and lacinia of the maxilla
of an insect. There is an approach,
as we shall see, in the
mandible of Copris, to that of
the Julidæ, but in insects in
general the lacinia is wanting,
and the jaw consists of but a
single piece.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deutomalæ (gnathochilarium), or second pair of diplopod jaws,
are analogous to the labium or second maxillæ of insects, forming a
flattened, plate-like under-lip, constituting the floor of the mouth
(Fig. 6). This pair of appendages needs farther study, especially
in the late embryo, before it can be fully understood. So far as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>known, judging by Metschnikoff’s work on the embryology of the
diplopods, these myriopods seem to have in the embryo but two
pairs of post-antennal mouth-parts, which he designated as the
“mandibles” and “labium.” Meinert,
however, regards as a third pair of
mouth-parts or “labium” what in our
Fig. 7 is called the internal stipes (<i>stip.
i.</i>), behind which is a triangular plate,
<i>lamina labialis</i> (<i>lam. lab</i>), which he regards
as the sternite of the same segment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypopharynx, our “labiella,”

in some insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the clypeus of insects there
is apparently no homologue in
myriopods, though in certain diplopods
there is an interantennal
clypeal region. The labium of
insects is represented by a short,
broad piece, which, however, unlike
that of insects, is immovable, and
is flanked by a separate piece called
the <i>epilabrum</i> (Fig. 8). Vom Rath
has observed an epipharynx, which
has the same general relations as in
insects.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The embryology of myriopods is in many respects
like that of insects. The larva of diplopods
hatches with but few segments, and with but
three pairs of limbs; but these are not, as in
insects, appended to consecutive segments, but in
one species the third, and in another, <i>Julus multistriatus?</i>
(Fig. 10), the second, segment from the
head is footless, while Vom Rath represents the
first segment of an European Blaniulus as footless,
the feet being situated consecutively on segments
2 to 4. The new segments arise at “the growing
point” situated between the last and penultimate
segment, growing out in groups of sixes (Newport)
or in our <i>Julus multistriatus?</i> in fives (Fig. 10). In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>adult life diplopods (Julus) have a single pair of limbs on the three
first segments, or those corresponding to the thoracic segments of
insects, the succeeding segments
having two pairs to each segment.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Sinclair (Heathcote) regards each
double segment in the diplopods as not
two original segments fused together,
nor a single segment bearing two pairs
of legs, but as “two complete segments
perfect in all particulars, but united by
a large dorsal plate which was originally
two plates which have been fused
together.” (Myriopods, 1895, p. 71.)
That the segments were primitively
separate is shown, he adds, by the
double nature of the circulatory system,
the nerve cord, and the first traces
of segmentation in the mesoblast.
Kenyon believes that from the conditions
in pauropods, Lithobius, etc.,
there are indications of alternate plates
(not segments) having disappeared,
and of the remaining plates overgrowing
the segments behind them, so as
to give rise to the anomalous double
segments.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Diplopods are also provided
with eversible coxal sacs, in
position like those of Symphyla and Synaptera; Meinert, Latzel,
and also Haase having detected them in several species of Chordeumidæ,
Lysiopetalidæ, and Polyzonidæ
(Fig. 11). In <i>Lysiopetalum anceps</i> these
blood-gills occur in both sexes between the
coxæ of the third to sixteenth pair of limbs.
In the Diplopods the blood-gills appear to
be more or less permanently everted, while
in Scolopendrella they are usually retracted
within the body (Fig. 15, <i>cg</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Diplopods also differ externally from insects
in the genital armature, a complicated apparatus of male
claspers and hooks apparently arising from the sternum of the sixth
segment and being the modified seventh pair of legs. In myriopods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>there are no pleural pieces or “pleurites,” so characteristic of winged
insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the most fundamental difference between diplopods and
insects is the fact that the paired genital openings of the former are
situated not far behind the head between the second and third pair
of legs. Both the oviducts and male ejaculatory ducts are paired,
with separate openings. The genital glands lie beneath, while in
chilopods they lie above the intestine; this, as Korschelt and Heider
state, being a more primitive relation, since in Peripatus they also
lie above the digestive canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nervous system of diplopods is not only remarkable for the
lack of the tendency towards a fusion of the ganglia observable in
insects, but for the fact that the double segments are each provided
with two ganglia. The brain also is very small in proportion to
the ventral cord, the nervous system being in its general appearance
somewhat as in caterpillars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrangement of the tracheæ and stigmata is much as in insects,
but in the Diplopoda the tracheary system is more primitive than in
chilopods, a pair of stigmata and a pair of tracheal bundles occurring
in each segment, while the bundles are not connected by anastomosing
branches, branched tracheæ only occurring in the Glomeridæ.
The tracheæ themselves are without spiral threads (tænidia). It
is noteworthy that the tracheæ arise much later than in insects, not
appearing until the animal is hatched; in this respect the myriopods
approximate Peripatus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Chilopoda also the parts of the head, except the epicranium,
are not homologous with those of insects, neither are the mouth-parts,
of which there are five pairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The structure of the head of centipedes is shown in part in Fig.
12, compare also Fig. 8. It will be seen that it differs much from
that of the diplopods, though the mandibles (protomalæ) are homologous;
they are divided into a cardo and stipes, thus being at least
two-jointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second pair of postoral appendages is in centipedes very different
from the gnathochilarium of diplopods. As seen in Fig. 12 <span class='small'>2</span>,
they are separate, cylindrical, fleshy, five-jointed appendages, the
maxillary appendages of Newport, which are “connected transversely
at their base with a pair of soft appendages” (<i>c</i>), the lingua
of Newport. The third and fourth pair are foot-jaws, and we have
called them <i>malipedes</i>, as they have of course no homology with the
maxillipedes of Crustacea. The second pair of these malipedes,
forming the last pair of mouth-appendages, is the poison-fangs (4),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>which are intermediate between the malipedes and the feet; Meinert
does not allow that these are mouth-appendages.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The embryology of Geophilus by Metschnikoff shows plainly the
four pairs of post-antennal appendages. The embryo Geophilus is
hatched in the form of the adult, having, unlike the diplopods, no
metamorphosis, its embryological history being condensed or abbreviated.
But in examining Metschnikoff’s figures certain primitive
diplopod features are revealed. The body of the embryo shortly
before hatching is cylindrical; the sternal region is much narrower
than in the adult, hence the insertions of the feet are nearer together,
while <i>the first six pairs of appendages begin to grow out before the
hinder ones</i>. Thus the first six pairs of appendages of the embryo
Geophilus correspond to the antennæ, two pairs of jaws, and three
pairs of legs of the larval Julus. These features appear to indicate
that the chilopods may be an offshoot from the diplopod stem. The
acquisition of a second pair of legs to a segment in diplopods, as in
the phyllopod Crustacea, is clearly enough a secondary character,
as shown by the figures of Newport in his memoir on the development
of the Myriopoda (Pl. IV.). Thus the tendency in the
Myriopoda, both diplopods and chilopods, is towards the multiplication
of segments and the elongation of the body, while in insects
the polypodous embryo has the three terminal segments of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>abdomen well formed, these being, however, before hatching, partly
atrophied, so that the body of insects after birth tends to become
shortened or condensed. This indicates the descent of insects from
ancestors with elongated polypodous hind-bodies like Scolopendrella.
Korschelt and Heider suggest that the stem-form of myriopods was
a homonomously jointed form like Peripatus, consisting of a rather
large number of segments, but we might, with Haase, consider that
the great number of segments which we now find indicates a late
acquisition of this form.</p>

<p class='c007'>The genital opening in chilopods is single, and situated in the
penultimate segment of the body, as in insects. While recognizing
the close relationship of the Myriopoda with the insects, it still
seems advisable not to unite them into a single group (as Oudemans,
Lang, and others would do), but to regard them as forming an
equivalent class. On the other hand, when we take into account
the form and structure of the head, antennæ, and especially the
shape of the first pair of mouth-appendages, being at least two-jointed
in both groups, we think these characters, with the homonomously
segmented body behind the head, outweigh the difference
in the position of the genital outlet, important as that may seem.
It should also be taken into account that while insects are derived
from polypodous ancestors, no one supposes, with the exception of
one or two authors, that these ancestors are the Myriopoda, the latter
having evidently descended from a six-legged ancestor, quite different
from that of the Campodea ancestor of insects.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the sexual openings of worms, though their position
is in general in the anterior part of the body, it is still very variable,
though, in general, paired. In the oligochete worms the genital zone,
with the external openings, is formed by the segments lying between
the 9th and 14th rings, though in some the genital organs are
situated still nearer the head. The myriopods, which evolved from
the worms earlier than insects, appear to have in their most primitive
forms (the Diplopoda) retained this vermian position of the
genital outlets. In the later forms, the chilopods, the genital openings
have been carried back to near the end of the body, as in
insects. From observations made by three different observers on
the freshly hatched larva of the Julidæ, it appears that the ancestral
diplopods were six-footed, or oligopod, the larva of Pauropus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>(Fig. 13) approaching nearest to our idea of the ancestral myriopod,
which might provisionally be named Protopauropus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Relations of the Symphyla to Insects.</b>—Opinions respecting the
position of the Symphyla, represented by Scolopendrella (Fig. 14),
are very discordant. By most writers since Newport, Scolopendrella
has been placed among the myriopods.
The first author, however, to examine
its internal anatomy was Menge (1851), who
discovered among other structures (tracheæ,
etc.) the silk-glands situated in the last two segments, and which
open at the end of each cercus. He regarded the form as “the
type of a genus or family intermediate between the hexapod
Lepismidæ and the Scolopendridæ.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1873<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the writer referred to this form as follows: “It may

<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and shows the intimate relation of the
myriopods and the hexapods, perhaps not sufficiently
appreciated by many zoölogists.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1880 Ryder regarded it as “the last survival
of the form from which insects may be supposed to
have descended,” and referred it to “the new ordinal
group Symphyla, in reference to the singular
combination of myriopodous, insectean, and thysanurous

<p class='c007'>Wood-Mason considered it
to be a myriopod, and “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>descendant of a group of myriopods from which the Campodeæ,
Thysanura, and Collembola may have sprung.” We are indebted
to Grassi for the first extended work on the morphology of Scolopendrella
(1885). In 1886 he added to our knowledge facts
regarding the internal anatomy, and gives a detailed comparison
with the Thysanura, besides pointing out the resemblances of Scolopendrella
to Pauropus, diplopods, chilopods, as well as Peripatus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1888 Grassi expressed his view as to the position of the
Symphyla, stating that it should not be included in the Thysanura,
since it evidently has myriopod characters; these being the supraspinal
vessel, the ventral position of the genital glands; the situation
of the genital opening in the fourth segment of the trunk, its
ganglionic chain being like that of diplopods, its having limbs on
all the segments, etc. On the other hand, Grassi has with much
detail indicated the points of resemblance to the Thysanura. The
principal ones are the thin integument, the want of sympathetic
ganglia, the presence of a pair of cephalic stigmata, like that said
to occur in certain Collembola, and in the embryo of Apis; two
endoskeletal processes situated near the ventral fascia of the head;
the epicranial suture also occurring in Thysanura, Collembola,
Orthoptera, and other winged insects, and being absent in diplopods
and chilopods. He also adds that the digestive canal both in
Symphyla and Thysanura is divided into three portions; the malpighian
tubes in Thysanura present very different conditions (there
being none in Japyx), among which may be comprised those of
Scolopendrella. In both groups there is a single pair of salivary
glands. The cellular epithelium of the mid-intestine of Scolopendrella
is of a single form as in Campodea and Japyx. The fat-body,
dorsal vessel, with its valves and ostia, are alike in the two
groups, as are the appendages of the end of the abdomen, the anal
cerci (cercopoda) of Scolopendrella being the homologues of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>multiarticulate appendages of Lepisma, etc., and of the forceps of
Japyx. In those of Scolopendrella, we have found the large duct
leading from the voluminous silk-gland, a single large sac extending
forwards into the third segment from the end of the body (Fig.
15, <i>s. gl</i>). Other points of resemblance, all of which he enumerates,
are the slight differences in the number of trunk-segments, the presence
in the two groups of the abdominal “false-legs” (parapodia),
the dorsal plate, and the mouth-parts. As regards the latter, Grassi
affirms that there is a perfect parallelism between those of Scolopendrella
and Thysanura. To this point we will return again in treating
more especially of those of the Symphyla. Finally, Grassi
concludes that there is “a great resemblance between the Thysanura
and Scolopendrella.” He, however, believed that the Symphyla
are the forerunners of the myriopods, and not of the insects, his
genealogical tree representing the symphylan and thysanuran phyla
as originating from the same point, this point also being, rather
strangely, the point of origin of the arachnidan phylum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haase (1889) regarded Scolopendrella as a myriopod, and Pocock
(1893) assigned the Symphyla to an independent class, regarding
Scolopendrella as “the living form that comes nearest to the
hypothetical ancestor of the two great divisions of tracheates.”
Schmidt’s work (1895) on the morphology of this genus is more
extended and richly illustrated than Grassi’s, his method of research
being more modern. He also regards this form as one of the lower
myriopods.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion, it appears to us that, on the whole, if we throw out
the single characteristic of the anteriorly situated genital opening,
the ovarian tubes being directed toward the end of the body (Fig. 15,
<i>ovd</i>, <i>ov</i>), there is not sufficient reason for placing the Symphyla
among the Myriopoda, either below or near the diplopods. This
is the only valid reason for not regarding Scolopendrella as the
representative of a group from which the insects have descended,
and which partly fills the wide abyss between Peripatus and insects.
With the view of Pocock, that both insects and myriopods have
descended from Scolopendrella, we do not agree, because this form
has so many insectean features, and a single unpaired genital opening.
For the same reason we should not agree with Schmidt in
interpolating the Symphyla between the Pauropoda and Diplopoda.
In these last two progoneate groups the genital openings are paired,
hence they are much more primitive types than Scolopendrella, in
which there is but a single opening. It seems most probable that
the Symphyla, though progoneate, are more recent forms than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>progoneate myriopods, which have retained the primitive feature of
double sexual outlets. It is more probable that the Symphyla were
the descendants of these polypodous forms. Certainly Scolopendrella
is the only extant arthropod which, with the sole exception
of the anteriorly situated genital opening, fulfils the conditions
required of an ancestor of Thysanura, and through them of the
winged insects. No one has been so bold as to suggest the derivation
of insects from either diplopods or chilopods, while their origin
from a form similar to Scolopendrella seems not improbable. Yet
Uzel has very recently discovered that Campodea develops in some
respects like Geophilus, the primitive band sinking in its middle into
the yolk, with other features as in chilopods.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The retention of a
double sexual opening in the diplopods is paralleled by the case of
Limulus with its double or paired sexual outlets, opening in a pair
of papillæ, as compared with what are regarded as the generalized
or more primitive Crustacea, which have an unpaired sexual
opening.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following summary of the structural features of the Symphyla,
as represented by Scolopendrella, is based mainly on the
works of Grassi, Haase, and Schmidt, with observations of my own.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Diagnostic or essential characters of Symphyla.</b>—<i>Head shaped as
in Thysanura (Cinura), with the Y-shaped tergal suture, which occurs
commonly in insects (Thysanura, Collembola, Dermaptera, Orthoptera,
Platyptera, Neuroptera, etc.), but is wanting in Myriopoda (Diplopoda
and Chilopoda); antennæ<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> unlike those of Myriopoda in being very long,
slender, and moniliform. Clypeus distinct. Labrum emarginate, with
six converging teeth. Mandibles 2–jointed, consisting of a vestigial
stipes and distal or molar joint, the latter with eight teeth. First maxillæ
with an outer and inner mala situated on a well-developed stipes;
with a minute, 1–jointed palpus. Second pair of maxillæ: each forming
two oblong flat pieces, median sutures distinct, with no palpi; these
pieces are toothed in front, and appear to be homologous with the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>median pieces of the gnathochilarium of Diplopoda. Hypopharynx?
Epipharynx?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>Trunk with from fifteen to sixteen dorsal, more or less free subequal
scutes, the first the smallest. Pedigerous segments twelve; also twelve
pairs of 5–jointed legs, which are of nearly equal length, the first pair 4–,
the others 5–jointed, all ending in two claws, as in Synaptera and winged
insects. A pair of 1–jointed anal cerci homologous with those of Thysanura
and Orthoptera, into each of which opens a large abdominal
silk-gland. Abdominal segments with movable styles or “pseudopods”
(“Parapodia” of Latzel and of Schmidt), like those of Campodea and
Machilis, and situated on the base of the coxal joint in front of the ventral
sac. Within the body near the base of each abdominal style is an
eversible coxal sac or blood-gill (Fig. 15, cg). The single genital opening
is on the fourth trunk-segment in both sexes (Fig. 15, indicated by the
arrow). The malpighian tubes (ur. t) are two in number, opening into
the digestive canal at the anterior end of the hind intestine; they extend
in front to the third or second segment from the head. They are broad
and straight at their origin, becoming towards the end very slender and
convoluted.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>The three divisions of the digestive tract are as in insects, the epithelium
of the mid-gut being histologically as in Campodea and Japyx;
rectal glands are present. A pair of very large salivary glands are
situated in the first to the fourth trunk-segments, consisting of a glandular
portion with its duct, which unite into a common duct opening on
the under side of the head, probably in the labium.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>But a single pair of stigmata is present, and these are situated in the
front of the head, beneath the insertion of the antennæ and within the
stipes of the mandibles; the tracheæ are very fine, without spiral threads
(tænidia), and mostly contained within the head, two fine branches
extending on each side into the second trunk-segment.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>After birth the body increases in length by the addition of new segments
at the growing point.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>In respect to the nervous system, there are no diagnostic characters;
there are, however, not as many as two pairs of ganglia to a
segment. The brain is well developed, sending a pair of slender
nerves to the small eyes. The ganglia of the segment bearing the
first pair of legs is fused with the subœsophageal ganglion. Grassi
was unable to detect a true sympathetic system, but he suspects the
existence of a very small frontal ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slender dorsal vessel, provided with ostia and valvules, pulsates
along the entire length of the trunk; an aorta passes into the
head.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The internal genital organs of both sexes are paired, and extend
along the greater part of the trunk; in either sex they may be compared
to two long, slender, straight cords extending from the fourth
to the tenth pair of legs. The two oviducts do not unite before
reaching the sexual opening (Fig. 15, <i>ovd</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The male sexual organs are more complicated than the feminine.
The paired testicular tubes lie in trunk-segments 6 to 12, on each
side, and partly under the intestinal canal, communicating with
each other by a cross-anastomosis situated under the intestine, and
which, like the testes, is filled with sperm. Of the paired seminal
ducts (vas deferens) in trunk-segment 4, each unites again into
a thick tube, sending a blind tube forward into the third segment.
Under the place of union of the two vasa deferentia arise the paired
ductus ejaculatorii, which open beneath in the uterus masculinus.
The anterior blind ends of the vasa deferentia form a sort of small
paired vesiculæ seminales in which a great quantity of ripe sperm
is stored. The uterus masculinus is in its structure homologous
with the evaginable penis of Pauropus, Polyxenus, and some diplopods,
and the sexual opening has without doubt become secondarily
unpaired. The sexual opening is rather long and is closed by two
longitudinal folds. “In several respects the male sexual organs of
Scolopendrella are like those of Pauropus; in the last-named form
we have indeed an unpaired testis, but also in Scolopendrella we
see the beginning of such a singleness; namely, the presence of an
anastomosis uniting the two tubes, their communication by means
of a transverse connecting canal and a glandular structure in the
epithelium forming them. The male sexual organs of Pauropus
differ only through a still greater complication.” (Schmidt.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Scolopendrella in habits resembles chilopods, being found in
company with Geophilus burrowing deep in light sand under leaves,
or living at the surface of the ground under sticks or stones. It is
very agile in its movements, and is probably carnivorous. It was
considered by Haase to be eyeless, but the presence of two ocelli
has been demonstrated both by Grassi and by Schmidt. Whether
the pigment and corneous facet are present is not certain. The
embryology is entirely unknown (although Henshaw reports finding
a hexapodous young one), and it need not be said that a knowledge
of it is a very great desideratum. It is most probable that the
young is hexapodous, since the first pair of limbs are 4–jointed,
all the rest 5–jointed; while Newport, and also Ryder, observed
specimens with nine, ten, eleven, and twelve pairs, and Wood-Mason
confirms their observations, “which prove that a pair of legs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>is added at each moult,” and he concludes that the addition of new
segments “therefore takes place in this animal by the intercalation
of two at each moult between the antepenultimate and penultimate
sterna, as in the Chilognatha, and as also in some of the Chilopoda.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is but one family, Scolopendrellidæ, and a single genus,
Scolopendrella, which seems to be, like other archaic types, cosmopolitan
in its distribution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our commonest species is <i>S. immaculata</i> Newport, which occurs from Massachusetts
to Cordova, Mexico, and in Europe from England to the Mediterranean
and Russia; Mr. O. F. Cook tells me he has found a species in Liberia, West
Africa. The other species are <i>S. notacantha</i> Gervais, Europe and Eastern
United States; <i>S. nivea</i> Scopoli (<i>S. gratiæ</i> Ryder), Europe and United States;
<i>S. latipes</i> Scudder, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are now prepared to discuss the fundamental or essential
characters of the insects, including the wingless subclass (Synaptera),
and the winged (Pterygota).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Diagnostic characters of insects.</b>—<i>Body consisting of not more than
twenty-one segments, which are usually heteronomous or of unequal size
and shape, arranged in three usually well-defined regions</i>; i.e. <i>a head,
thorax, and hind-body or abdomen. Head small and flattened or

structures. The head is composed of an epicranium, bearing a distinct
clypeus and labrum, with the epipharynx. Mandibles 1–jointed,
without a palpus and very generally with no, or uncertain, traces of a
lacinia and a stipes. Two pairs of maxillæ; the first pair separate,
usually 3–lobed, comprising a lacinia, galea, and palpifer, with a palpus
which is never more than 6–jointed. The second pair united to form
the labium or under lip, composed of two laciniæ fused together; in the
generalized forms with a rudimentary galea; bearing a pair of palpi,
never more than 4–jointed; with paraglossæ sometimes present.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>The digestive canal in the winged orders is highly differentiated, the
fore-intestine being divided into an œsophagus and proventriculus, the
hind-intestine into an ileum, colon, and rectum, with rectal glands.</i></p>

<p class='c007'><i>The nervous system consists of a well-developed brain, in the more

<p class='c007'><i>Stigmata confined (except possibly in Sminthurus) to the thorax and

<p class='c007'><i>Development either direct (Synaptera), or with an incomplete (with
nymph and winged or imaginal stages), or complete metamorphosis; in
the latter case with a larval, pupal, and imago stage.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The insects may be divided into two sub-classes,—the <i>Synaptera</i>,
and the winged orders, <i>Pterygota</i>, of Gegenbaur (1877), since the
differences between the two groups appear on the whole to be of
more than ordinal rank.</p>

<h3 class='c002'>1. EXTERNAL ANATOMY</h3>
<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The regions of the body</h4>

<p class='c016'>The insects differ from other arthropods in that the body is divided
into three distinct regions,—the head, thorax, and abdomen, the
latter regions in certain generalized forms not always very distinctly
differentiated. The body behind the head may also conveniently
be called the trunk, and the segments composing it the trunk-segments.</p>

<p class='c007'>In insects the head is larger in proportion to the trunk than in
other classes, notably the Crustacea; the thorax is usually slightly
or somewhat larger than the head, while the hind-body or abdomen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is much the larger region, as it consists of ten to eleven, and perhaps
in the Dermaptera and Orthoptera twelve, segments, and contains
the mid- and hind-intestine, as well as the reproductive organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we compare the body of an insect with that of a worm, in
which the rings are distinctly developed, we see that in insects ring
distinctions have given way to regional distinctions. The segments
lose their individuality. It is comparatively easy to trace the segments
in the hind-body of an insect, as in this region they are least
modified; so with the thorax; but in the head of the adult insect it
is impossible to discover the primitive segments, as they are fused
together into a sort of capsule, and have almost entirely lost their
individuality.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general it may be said that the head contains or bears the
organs of sense and of prehension and mastication of the food; the
thorax the organs of locomotion; and the abdomen those of reproduction.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we compare the body of a wasp or bee with that of a worm,
we see that there is a decided transfer of parts headward; this process
of cephalization so marked in the Crustacea likewise obtains in
insects. Also the two hinder regions of the body are, in a much
greater degree than in worms, governed by the brain, the principal
seat of the intelligence, which, so to speak, dominates and unifies
the functions of the body, both digestive, locomotive, and reproductive,
as also those of the muscles moving the different segments
and regions of the body. To a large extent arthropodan morphology
and class distinctions are based on the regional arrangement of the
somites themselves. Thus in the process of grouping of the segments
into the three regions, some increase in size, while others
undergo a greater or less degree of reduction; one segment being
developed at the expense of one or more adjoining ones. This
principle was first pointed out by Audouin, and is called Audouin’s
law. It is owing to the greater development of certain segments
and the reduction of others, both of the body-segments and of the
segments of the limbs, that we have the wonderful diversity of
form in the species and genera, and higher groups of insects, as
well as those of other arthropods.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The integument (exoskeleton)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The skin or integument of insects consists, primarily, as in worms
and all arthropods, of an epithelial layer of cells called the <i>hypodermis</i>.
This layer secretes the cuticle, which is of varying thickness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and flexibility, and is usually very dense, impermeable, and
light, compared with the crust of the Crustacea, where the cuticle
becomes heavy and solid by the deposition of the carbonate and
phosphate of lime. This is due to the presence of a substance called
by Odier chitin.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The cuticle is thin, delicate, and flexible between
the joints; it is likewise so in such diaphanous aquatic larvæ as
that of Corethra, and in the gills of aquatic insects, also in the walls
of the tracheæ and of the salivary ducts. The cuticle thus forms
a more or less solid crust which is broken into joints and pieces
(sclerites), forming supports for the attachments of the muscles and
serving to protect the soft parts within.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Chitin.</b>—If we allow an insect to soak for a long time in acids, or
boil it in liquid potassa or caustic potash, the integument is not
affected. The muscles and the other soft parts are dissolved, leaving
the cuticle clear and transparent. This insolubility of the cuticle
is due to the presence of chitin, the insoluble residue left after
such treatment. It also resists boiling in acids, in any alkalies,
alcohol or ether. The chemical formula is C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub>.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>“Chitin forms less than one-half by weight of the integument, but it is so
coherent and uniformly distributed that when isolated by chemical reagents, and
even when cautiously calcined, it retains its original organized form. The color
which it frequently exhibits is not due to any essential ingredient; it may be
diminished or even destroyed by various bleaching processes.” (Miall and
Denny.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“The chemical stability of chitin is so remarkable that we might expect it to
accumulate like the inorganic constituents of animal skeletons, and form permanent
deposits. Schlossberger (Ann. d. chem. u. pharm., bd. 98) has, however,
shown that it changes slowly under the action of water. Chitin kept for a year
under water partially dissolved, turned into a slimy mass, and gave off a peculiar
smell. This looks as if it were liable to putrefaction. The minute proportion of
nitrogen in its composition may explain the complete disappearance of chitin in
nature.” (Miall and Denny, The Cockroach, p. 29.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Chitin, or a substance closely similar to it, occurs in worms and in their tubes,
especially in the pharyngeal teeth of annelids and in their setæ. The shell of
Lingula and the pen of cuttle-fish contain true chitin (Krukenberg). The integument
of Limulus, of trilobites, and of Arachnida, as well as Myriopoda, appears
to consist of chitin.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The chitin is rapidly deposited at the end of embryonic life, also
during the larval and pupal stages. As is well known, insects after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>moulting are white, but in a few hours turn dark, and those which
live in total darkness are white, showing that light has a direct effect
in causing the dark color of the integument.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moseley analyzed one pound weight of Blatta, and found plenty
of iron with a remarkable quantity of manganese.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schneider regarded chitin as a hardening of the protoplasm rather
than a secretion, and the cuticle is looked upon as an exudation. It
is structureless, not consisting of cells, and consists of fine irregular
laminæ. “A cross-section of the chitinous layer or ‘cuticle’ examined
with a high power shows extremely close and fine lines perpendicular
to the laminæ.” In the cockroach the free surface of
the cuticle is divided into polygonal, raised spaces or areas which
correspond each to a chitinous cell of the hypodermis. (Miall and
Denny.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Numerous pore-canals pass through the cuticle of all the external
parts of the body. The larger canals nearly always form the way
for the passage of secretions from dermal cells, or connect with the
cavities of hairs or setæ; when very fine and not connected with
hairs or scales, they are either empty or filled with air, and may possibly
serve for respiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vosseler distinguishes in the cuticle two layers of different physical
and chemical characters. Besides the external chitinous layer
there is an inner layer which entirely agrees with cellulose. (Zool.
Centralblatt, ii, 1895, p. 117.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The reparative nature of chitin is seen in the fact that Verhoeff
finds that a wound on an adult Carabus, and presumably on other
insects, is speedily closed, not merely by a clot of blood, but by a
new growth of chitin.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Mechanical origin and structure of the segments (somites, arthromeres, metameres, zonites)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The segments are merely thickenings of the skin connected by
folds or duplications of the integument, and not actually separate or
individual rings or segments. This is shown by longitudinal (sagittal)
sections through the body, and also by soaking or boiling the
entire insect in caustic potash, when it is seen that the integument
is continuous and not actually subdivided into separate somites
or arthromeres, since they are seen to be connected by a thin intersegmental
membrane (Fig. 16). But this segmentation or metamerism
of the integument is, however, the external indication of the
segmentation of the arthropodan body most probably inherited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>from the worms, being a disposition of the soft parts which is
characteristic of the vermian type. This segmentation of the integument
is correlated with the serial repetition of the ganglia of the
nervous system, of the ostia of the dorsal vessel, the
primitive disposition of the segmental and reproductive
organs, of the soft, muscular dissepiments which
correspond to the suture between the segments, and
with the metameric arrangement of the muscles
controlling the movements of the segments on each
other, and which internal segmentation or metamerism
is indicated very early in embryonic life
by the mesoblastic somites.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the unjointed worms, as Graber states, the body
forms a single but flexible lever. In the earthworm
the muscular tube or body-wall is enclosed by a stiffer
cuticle, divided into segments; hence the worm can
move in all required directions, but only by sections,
as seen in Fig. 16, which represents the thickened
integument divided into segments, and folded inward
between each segment, this thin portion of the skin being the intersegmental
fold. Each segment corresponds to a special zone of the
subdivided muscular tube
(<i>m</i>), the fascia extending
longitudinally. The figure
shows the mode of attachment
of the fascia of the
muscle-tube to the segment.
The anterior edge
is inserted on the stiff, unyielding,
inner surface of
each segment: the hinder
edge of the muscle is attached
to the thin, flexible,
intersegmental fold,
which thus acts as a tendon
on which the muscle
can exert its force. (Graber.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fig. 17 makes this still clearer. The muscles (<i>m</i>) extend between
two segments immediately succeeding each other. Supposing the
anterior one (<i>A</i>) to be stationary, what do we then see when the
muscle contracts? Does it also become shorter? The intersegmental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>fold is drawn forwards, and hence the entire hinder segment
moves forward and is shoved into the front one, and so on with the
others, as at <i>B</i>. Afterwards, if the strain of the muscle is relieved
by the diminishing action of
the tensely stretched, intersegmental
membrane, it
again returns to a state of
rest.” (Graber.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>While we look upon the
dermal tube of worms as a
single but flexible lever, the
body of the arthropods, as
Graber states, is a linear
system of stiff levers. We
have here a series of stiff,
solid rings, or hooks, united
by the intersegmental membrane
into a whole. When
the muscles, extending from
one ring to the next behind
contract, and so on through
the entire series, the rings
approximate each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ectoskeletal segments
bend to one side by the contraction
of the muscles on
one side, the point of the
outer segmental fold opposite
the fixed point becoming
converted into the turning-point
(<i>C</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The usual result of the
arrangement of the locomotive
system is the simple
curving of the body (<i>C</i>), and
then the alternate bending
of the body to right and
left, which produces the serpentine movements characteristic of the
earthworms, the centipede, and many insect larvæ. The most striking
example of the wonderful variety of movements which can be
made by an insect are those of the Syrphus larva. When feeding
amid a herd of aphides, it is seen to now raise the front part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>body erect and stiff, then to bend it down, or rapidly turn it to either
side, or move it in a complete circle. (Graber, pp. 23–26.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrangement and mode of working of the muscles, says Lang,
is illustrated by Fig. 18, which shows us five segments, one larger
(<i>ct</i>) and four smaller, in vertical projection. The thicker portion
of the integument is marked by strong outlines, the delicate and
flexible interarticular membranes (<i>tg</i>, <i>sg</i>) in dotted lines. The hinges
between two consecutive segments are marked <i>a</i>. A dorsal muscle
(<i>d</i>) is attached to the larger segment (<i>ct</i>), and runs through the
smaller segments, being inserted in the dorsal portion of the crust
(<i>t</i>) of each by means of a bundle of fibres. A ventral muscle (<i>v</i>)
does the same on the sternal side (<i>s</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>“The skeletal segments,” adds Lang, “may be compared to a
double-armed lever, whose fulcrum lies in the hinges. If the dorsal
muscle contracts, it draws the dorsal arm of the lever (the tergal
portion of the skeleton) in the direction of the pull towards the
larger segments; the tergal interarticular membranes become folded,
the ventral stretched, and the four segments bend upward (Fig. 18,
<i>A</i>). If the ventral muscle contracts, while at the same time the
dorsal slackens, the row of segments will be bent downwards
(Fig. 18, <i>C</i>).”</p>

<p class='c007'>L. B. Sharp suggests, that in the Crustacea the rings formed by
“the regularity and stress of muscular action” would be hardened
by the deposition of lime at the most prominent portion, <i>i.e.</i> between
what we have called the intersegmental folds. (American Naturalist,
1893, p. 89.) Cope also states that “with the beginning of induration
of the integument, segmentation would immediately appear, for
the movements of the body and limbs would interrupt the deposit at
such points as would experience the greatest flexure. The muscular
system would initiate the process, since flexure depends on its contractions,
and its presence in animals prior to the induration of the
integuments in the order of phylogeny, furnishes the conditions required.”
(The Primary Factors of Organic Evolution, p. 268, 1895.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is apparent that the jointed or metameric structure of the
bodies of insects and other arthropods is an inheritance from the
segmented worms. In the worms the body is a continuous dermo-muscular
tube, while in arthropods this tube is divided into regions,
and the cuticle is thicker and more resistant. To go back to the
incipient stages in the process of segmentation of the body, we conceive
that the worms probably arose from a creeping gastrula-like
form, the gastræa. The act of creeping gradually induced an elongated
shape of the body. The movement of such an organism in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>forward direction would gradually evolve a fore and aft, dorsal
and ventral, and bilateral symmetry. As soon as this was attained,
as the effect of creeping over rough irregular surfaces there would
result mechanical lateral strains intermittently acting during the
serpentine movements of the worm. The integument would, we can
readily suppose, tend to bend or yield, or become permanently
wrinkled, at more or less regular intervals. The arrangement of
the muscles would gradually conform to this habit of creeping, and
finally the nervous system and
other organs more directly connected
with the creeping movements
of the organism would tend
to be correlated in their arrangement
with that of the segments.
In this way the homonomous segments
of the annelid body probably
became developed, and their
relations and shapes were eventually
fixed by inheritance. After
this stage was reached, and limbs
began to appear, the segments
would tend to become heteronomous,
and to be grouped into
regions.</p>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 19.</span>—<i>Dujardinia rotifera</i>, with jointed tentacles and caudal appendages.—With some changes, after Quatrefages.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The origin of the joints or segments
in the limbs of arthropods
was probably due to the mechanical
strains to which what were at first
soft fleshy outgrowths along the
sides of the body became subjected.
Indeed, certain annelid
worms of the family Syllidæ have
segmented tentacles and parapodia,
as in Dujardinia (Fig. 19).
We do not know enough about the habits of these worms to understand
how this metamerism may have arisen, but it is possibly due
to the act of pushing or repeated efforts to support the body while
creeping over the bottom among broken shells, over coarse gravel,
or among seaweeds.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious, however, that the jointed structure of the limbs of
arthropods, if we are to attempt any explanation at all of the origin
of such structure, was primarily due mainly to lateral strains and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>impacts resulting from the primitive endeavors of the ancestral
arthropods to raise and to support the body while thus raised,
and then to push or drag it forward by means of the soft, partially
jointed, lateral limbs which were armed with bristles, hooks, or
finally claws.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, by adaptation, or as the result of parasitism and
consequent lack of active motion, the original number of segments
may by disuse be diminished. Thus in adult wasps and bees, the
last three or four abdominal segments may be nearly lost, though the
larval number is ten. During metamorphosis the body is made
over, and the number, shape, and structure of the segments greatly
modified. In the female of the Stylopidæ the thorax loses all traces
of segments, and is fused with the head, and the abdominal segments
are faintly marked, losing their chitin.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the maxillæ have several joints, the mandibles are 1–jointed,
but there are traces of two joints in Campodea, certain beetles, etc.
In the antenna there is a great elasticity in respect to the number
of joints, which vary from one or two to a hundred or more. It
is likewise so in the thoracic legs, where the number of tarsal joints
varies from one to five; also in the cercopoda, the number of joints
varying from one or two to twelve or more.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> Mechanical origin of the limbs and of their jointed structure</h4>

<p class='c016'>We have already hinted at the mode of origin of the limbs of
arthropods. Like the body or trunk, the limbs are chitinous dermo-muscular
tubes, with a dense solid cuticle, and internal muscles,
and were it not for their division at more or less regular intervals
into segments, forming distinct sets of levers, set up by the strains
in these tubular supports, there would be no power of varied motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even certain worms, as already stated, have their tentacles and
parapodia, or certain appendages of their parapodia, more or less
jointed, but there are no indications of claws or of any other hard
chitinous armature at the extremity, and the skin is thin and soft.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the most simple though not the most primitive arthropods,
such as the Tardigrades, whose body is not segmented, there are
four pairs of short unjointed legs, ending each in two claws, which
have probably arisen in response to the stimulus of pushing or
dragging efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legs of Peripatus are unjointed, and have a thin cuticle, but
end in a pair of claws, which have evidently arisen as a supporting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>armature, the result of the act of moving or pulling the body over
the uneven surface of the ground.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There is good reason to suppose that such limbs arose from dynamical
causes, similar to those exciting the formation of secondary
adaptations such as are to be seen in the prop or supporting legs of
certain dipterous larvæ, as the single pair of Chironomus (Fig. 20)
and Simulium, or the series of unjointed soft
tubercles of Ephydra (Fig. 21), etc., which are
armed with hooks and
claws, and are thus
adapted for dragging
the insect through or
over vegetation or
along the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now by frequent
continuous use of such
unjointed structures,
the cuticle would tend
to become hard, owing to the deposit of a greater amount of chitin
between the folds of the skin, until finally the body being elongated
and homonomously segmented, the movements of walking or running
would be regular and even, and we would have homonomously
jointed legs like those of the trilobites, or of the most generalized
Crustacea and of Myriopoda.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the most primitive arthropods,—and such we take it were on
the whole the trilobites, rather than the Crustacea,—the limbs were
of nearly the same shape, being long and slender and evenly jointed
from and including the antennæ, to the last pair of limbs of the
abdominal region. In these forms there appear to be, so far as we
now know, no differentiation into mandibles, maxillæ, maxillipedes,
and thoracic legs, or into gonopoda. The same lack of diversity of
structure and function of the head-appendages has survived, with
little change, in Limulus. In the trilobites (Fig. 1) none of the
limbs have yet been found to end in claws or forceps; being in this
respect nearly as primitive as in the worms. Secondary adaptations
have arisen in Limulus, the cephalic appendages being forcipated,
adapted as supports to the body and for pushing it onward through
the sand or mud, while the abdominal legs are broad and flat,
adapted for swimming and bearing the broad gill-leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is thus quite evident that we have three stages in the evolution
of the arthropodan limb; <i>i.e.</i> 1, the syllid stage, of simple, jointed,
soft, yielding appendages not used as true supports (Fig. 19); 2, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>trilobite stage, where they are more solid, evenly jointed, but not ending
in claws; and by their comparatively great numbers (as in the
trilobite, Triarthrus) fully supporting the body on the bottom of the
sea. In Limulus they are much fewer in number, thicker, and acting
as firm supports, the cephalic limbs of use in creeping, and ending in
solid claws. 3, The third stage is the long slender swimming head-appendages
of the nauplius stage of Crustacea.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the evolution of limbs of terrestrial arthropods, we
have the following stages: 1, the soft unjointed limbs of Tardigrades,
ending in two claws, and those of Peripatus, and the pseudo- or
prop-legs of certain dipterous larvæ; 2, finally the evolution of
the long, solid, jointed limbs of Pauropus and other primitive myriopods,
the legs forming solid, firm supports elevating the body, and
enabling the insect to drag itself over the ground or to walk or run.
When the body is elongated and many-segmented, the legs are necessarily
numerous; but when it is short, the legs become few in number,
<i>i.e.</i> six, in the hexapodous young of myriopods and in insects, or
eight in Arachnida. Whenever the legs are used for walking, <i>i.e.</i>
to raise and support the body, they end in a solid point or in a pair
of forceps or claws. On the other hand, as in phyllopods, where
the legs are used mainly for swimming, they are unarmed and are
soft and membranous, or, as in the limbs of the nauplius or zoëa
stage of crustaceans, end in a simple soft point, which often bears
tactile setæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tarsal joints are more numerous in order to give greater flexibility
to the limb in seizing and grasping objects, both to drag the
body forwards and to support it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike those of the Crustacea, the limbs of insects are not primitively
biramose, but single, the three-lobed first maxillæ, and secondarily
bilobed second maxillæ being the result of adaptation.
Embryology on the whole proves the truth of this assumption; the
maxillæ of both pairs are at first single buds, afterwards becoming
lobed. All the appendages of the body, including the ovipositor or
sting, are modified limbs, as shown by their embryological development.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is noticeable that in the crab, where the body is raised by the
limbs above the bottom, it is much shorter and more cephalized than
in the shrimps. Also in the simply walking and running spiders,
the hind-body is shorter than in scorpions, while in the running and
flying insects, such as the Cicindelidæ, and in the swiftly flying
flies and bees, there is a tendency to a shortening of the body,
especially of the abdomen. The long body of the dragon-fly is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>impediment to flight, but compensated for by the action of the large
wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arthropodan limb is a compound leverage system. It is, says
Graber, a lateral outgrowth of the trunk, which repeats in miniature
that of the main trunk, its single series of joints or segments forming
a jointed dermo-muscular tube. Yet the lateral appendages of
an insect differ from the main trunk in two ways: (1) they taper to
the end which bears the two claws, and (2) their segments are in the
living animal arranged not in a straight line, but at different angles
to each other. The basal joint turning on the trunk acts as the first
of a whole series of levers. The second joint, however, is connected
with the musculature of the first or basal joint, and thus each succeeding
joint is moved on the one preceding. Each lever, from
the first to the last, is both an active and a passive instrument.
(Graber.)</p>

<p class='c007'>While, however, as Graber states, the limbs possess their own sets
of muscles and can move by the turning of the basal joint, the labor
is very much facilitated, as is readily seen, by the trunk, though the
latter has to a great extent delegated its locomotive function to the
appendages, which again divide its labor among the separate joints.</p>

<p class='c007'>Graber then calls attention to the analogy of the mechanics of
locomotion of insects to those of vertebrates. An insect’s and a
vertebrate’s legs are constructed on the same general mechanical
principles, the limbs of each forming a series of levers.</p>

or shank. In the vertebrate
the internally situated
bones are brought
into close union and bend
by means of a hinge-joint;
so also in the chitinous-skinned
insect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stiff dermal tube
of the insect acts as a
lever by means of the
thin intersegmental membrane
(<i>c</i>) pushed in or
telescoped in to the thigh joint, a special joint-capsule being superfluous.
The muscles are in general the same in both types; they
form a circle. In both the shank is extended by the contraction of
the upper muscles (<i>d</i>) and is bent by the contraction of the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>(<i>d<sup>1</sup></i>). The intersegmental membrane of the insect’s limb is in a
degree a two-armed lever, whose pivot (<i>f</i>) lies in the middle. The
internal invagination of the intersegmental fold (<i>B</i>, <i>g-h</i>) affords the
necessary support to the muscles acting like the tendon in the vertebrate.

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Graber also calls attention to the fact that this insect limb differs
in one important respect from that of land vertebrates. The leverage
system in the last is divided at the end
into five parallel divisions or digits. In
arthropods, on the contrary, all the joints
succeed one another in a linear series.</p>

<p class='c007'>In insects, as well as in other arthropods,
modifications of the limbs usually take the
form of a simple reduction in the number of
segments. Thus while the normal number
of tarsal joints is five, we have trimerous
and dimerous Coleoptera, and in certain
Scarabæidæ the anterior tarsi are lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Savigny was the first, in 1816, in his great
work, “Théorie des organes de la bouche des
Crustacés et des Insectes,” to demonstrate
that not only were the buccal appendages of
biting insects homologous with those of
bugs, moths, flies, etc., but that they were
homologous with the thoracic legs, and that
thus a unity of structure prevails throughout
the appendages of the body of all
arthropods. Oken also observed that “the
maxillæ are only repeated feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What was modestly put forth as a theory by the French morphologist
has been abundantly proved by the embryology of insects
of different orders to be a fact. As shown in Fig. 23 the antennæ and
buccal appendages arise as paired tubercles exactly as the thoracic
legs. The abdominal region also bears similar embryonic or temporary
limbs, all of which in those insects without an ovipositor
disappear, except the cercopoda, after birth.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE HEAD AND ITS APPENDAGES</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The head</h4>

<div  class='figleft id023'>
<img src='images/i_060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 24.</span>—Presumed larva of Nemoptera (<i>Necrophilus arenarius</i>), Pyramids of Egypt.—After Roux, from Sharp.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>While the head is originally composed of probably not less than
six segments, these are in the adult insect fused together into a capsule
or hard chitinous box, the <i>epicranium</i>, with no distinct traces of
the primitive segments. The head contains the brain and accessory
ganglia, the mouth or buccal cavity, also the air-sacs in many winged
forms, and gives support to the external organs of sense, the
antennæ, and to the buccal appendages,
the larger part of the interior being
filled with the muscles moving these
structures. The solid walls of the head
serve as a lever or support for the
attachment of these muscles, especially
those of the mandibles. Thus there is
a correlation between the large size of
the mandibles of the soldier white ants
and ants, the head being correspondingly
large to accommodate the great
mandibular muscles. The other extreme
is seen in the larva of Necrophilus
(Fig. 24), with its long slender neck
and diminutive head.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The clypeus.</b>—This is that part of
the head situated in front of the epicranium,
and anterior to the eyes, forming
the roof of the posterior part of the mouth, and is, as embryology
shows, probably a tergal sclerite. It varies greatly in shape and size
in the different orders of insects. It is often divided into two parts,
the <i>clypeus posterior</i> and <i>clypeus anterior</i>, or which may be designated
as the <i>post-</i> and <i>ante-clypeus</i> (Figs. 29, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The labrum.</b>—The “upper lip” or labrum is an unpaired flap-like
piece hinged to the front edge of the clypeus, and may be seen to
move up and down when the insect moves its mandibles. It forms
the roof of the anterior part of the mouth (Figs. 69, 74), and its inner
side is lined with a soft membrane, usually provided with hairs and
sense-papillæ or cups, forming the epipharynx.</p>

<p class='c007'>The labrum is more or less deeply bilobed, especially in caterpillars
and in adult Staphylinidæ, and has been thought by some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>writers (Kowalevsky, Carrière, and also Chatin) to represent a pair
of appendages, but Heymons (1895) refutes this view, stating as his
reason that the labrum arises between the
two halves of the nervous system (protocerebrum),
while all the true appendages arise on
each side of the nervous system. (See also
Fig. 34.)</p>

<div  class='figright id013'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the fleas (Siphonaptera) both the clypeus
and labrum are wanting.</p>

<p class='c007'>While it apparently forms an anterior
specialized portion of the procephalic lobes,
Viallanes regarded it as belonging to the
third, or his tritocerebral, segment, since the
labral nerves arise from the tritocerebral
ganglia. But since in all the early as well
as late stages of embryonic life it appears
to be situated in front of the mouth, it would seem to belong
to the first segment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the embryo of Blatta it first appears as a thick crescentic fold
being slightly divided anterior to the mouth, and in Doryphora it
appears as a heart-shaped or deeply bilobed prominence situated in
front of the mouth (Wheeler).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The epipharynx and labrum-epipharynx.</b>—The epipharynx is the
under surface or pharyngeal lining of the clypeus and labrum, forming
the membranous roof of the mouth. As it contains the organs of
taste and has been generally overlooked by entomologists, we may
dwell at some length on its structure in different orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>Réaumur was, so far as we have been able to ascertain, the first
author to describe and figure the epipharynx, which he observed in
the honey bee and bumble bee, and called <i>la langue</i>, remarking that it
closes the opening into the œsophagus, and that it is applied against
the palate. According to Kirby and Spence, De Geer described the
epipharynx of the wasp; and Latreille referred to it, calling it the
<i>sous labre</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name <i>epipharynx</i> was bestowed upon this organ by Savigny,
who thus speaks of that of the bees: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce pharynx est, à la vérité,
non seulement caché par la lèvre supérieure, mais encore exactement
recouvert par un organe particulier que Réaumur a déjà décrit.
C’est une sorte d’appendice membraneux qui est reçu entre les deux
branches des mâchoires. Cette partie ayant pour base le bord
supérieur du pharynx, peut prendre le nom d’<i>épipharynx</i> ou d’<i>épiglosse</i>.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>He also describes that of Diptera. What Walter has lately
proved to be the epipharynx of Lepidoptera was regarded by Savigny
and all subsequent writers as the labrum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latest account of the function of this organ is that by Cheshire,
who states that the tube made by the maxillæ and labial palpi
cannot act as a suction pipe, because it is open above. “This opening
is closed by the front extension of the epipharynx, which closes down
to the maxillæ, fitting exactly into the space they leave uncovered,
and thus the tube is completed from their termination to the
œsophagus.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is singular that this organ is not mentioned in Burmeister’s
Manual of entomology, in Lacordaire’s Introduction à l’entomologie,
or by Newport in his admirable article
<i>Insecta</i> in Todd’s Cyclopedia of anatomy.
Neither has Straus-Durckheim
referred to or
figured it in
his great work
on the anatomy
of <i>Melolontha
vulgaris</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their excellent
work
on the cockroach,
Miall
and Denny
state that “The epipharynx, which is
a prominent part in Coleoptera and
Diptera, is not recognizable in Orthoptera” (p. 45). We have, however,
found it to be always present in this order (Figs. 26, 27).</p>

<p class='c007'>We are not aware that any modern writers have described or
referred to the epipharynx of the mandibulate orders of insects.
Although Dr. G. Joseph speaks of finding taste-organs on the
palate of almost every order of insects, especially plant-feeding
forms, we are unable to find any specific references, his detailed
observations being apparently unpublished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epipharynx is so intimately associated with the elongated
labium of certain Diptera, that, with Dr. Dimmock, we may refer to
the double organ as the labrum-epipharynx; and where, as in the
lepidopterous <i>Micropteryx semipurpurella</i>, described and figured by
Walter, and the Panorpidæ (Panorpa and Boreus), the labrum seems
pieced out with a thin, pale membranous fold which appears to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>an extension of the epipharynx, building up the dorsal end of the
labrum, this term is a convenient one to use.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the lower orders of truly mandibulate insects, from the Thysanura
to the Coleoptera, excluding those which suck in liquid food,
such as the Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera, and the
Mecoptera (Panorpidæ) with their elongated head and feeble, small
mandibles, the epipharynx forms a simple membranous palatal lining
of the clypeus and labrum. In such insects there is no soft projecting
or pendant portion, fitted to close the throat or to complete
a partially tubular arrangement of the first and second maxillæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all the mandibulate insects, then, the epipharynx forms simply
the under surface or pharyngeal lining of the clypeus and labrum,
the surface being uniformly moderately convex, and corresponding
in extent to that of the clypeus and labrum, posteriorly merging into
the palatal wall of the pharynx; the armature of peculiar gathering-hairs
sometimes spreading over its base, being continuous with those
lining the mouth and beginning of the œsophagus. The suture
separating the labrum from the clypeus does not involve the epipharynx,
though since certain gustatory fields lie under the front
edge of the clypeus, as well as labrum, one may in describing them
refer to certain fields or groups of cups or pits as occupying a labral
or clypeal region or position.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lack of traces of a suture in the epipharynx corresponding to
the labral suture above, suggests that the labrum does not represent
a pair of coalesced appendages, and that it, with the clypeus, simply
forms the solid cuticular roof of the mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only soft structures seen between the epipharynx and labrum,
besides the nerves of special sense, are the elevator muscles of the
labrum, and two tracheæ, one on each side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The structure and armature of the epipharyngeal surface even
besides the taste-pits, taste-cups and rods, is very varied, the setæ
assuming very different shapes. There seem to be two primary
forms of setæ, (1) the normal forms which arise from a definite cell;
and (2) soft, flattened, often hooked hairs which are cylindrical
towards the end, but arise from a broad triangular base, without
any cell-wall. These are like the “gathering hairs” of Cheshire,
situated on the bees’ and wasps’ tongue; they also line the walls of
the pharynx and extend toward the œsophagus. They are also
similar to the “hooked hairs” of Will. The first kind, or normal
setæ, are either simply defensive, often guarding the sense-cups or
sensory fields on which the sense-cups are situated, or they have a
nerve extending to them and are simply tactile in function.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The surface of the epipharynx, then, appears to be highly sensitive,
and to afford the principal seat of the gustatory organs, which
are described under the head of organs of taste.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Attachment of the head to the trunk.</b>—The head is either firmly
supported by the broad prothoracic segment in Orthoptera, many
beetles, etc., into which it is more or less retracted, or it is free and
attached by a slender neck, easily turning on the trunk, as in dragon-flies,
flies, etc. In some insects there are several chitinous plates,
situated on an island in the membrane on the under side of the neck;
these are the “cervical sclerites” of Sharp, occurring “in Hymenoptera,
in many Coleoptera, and in Blattidæ.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The basal or gular region of the head.</b>—At the hinder part of the
head is the opening (occipital foramen) into the trunk. The cheek
(gena) is the side of the head, and to its inner wall is attached the
mandibular muscle; it thus forms the region behind the eye and
over the base of the mandibles. In the Termitidæ, where the head
is broad and flat, it forms a distinct piece on the under side of the
head bounding the gulo-mental region (Fig. 28). In the Neuroptera
(Corydalus, Fig. 29, and Mantispa, Fig. 30) it is less definitely outlined.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>All the gulo-mental region of the head appears to represent the
base of the second maxillæ, and the question hence arises whether
the submentum is not the homologue
of the cardines of the first maxillæ
fused, and the mentum that of the
stipites of the latter also fused together.
If this should prove to be
the case, the homologies between the
two pairs of maxillæ will be still
closer than before supposed. Where
the gula is differentiated, this represents
the basal piece of the second
maxillæ. In Figs. 28, 29, 30, and 31,
these three pieces are clearly shown
to belong to the second maxillary segment.
It is evident that these pieces
or sclerites belong to the second
maxillary or labial segment of the
head, as does the occiput, which may
represent the tergo-pleural portion of
the segment. Miall and Denny also
regarded the submentum as the basal
piece of the second maxillæ.</p>

The occipital
region may be designated as that part
of the head adjoining and containing the
occipital foramen. Newport considers
the occiput as that portion of the base
of the head “which is articulated with
the anterior margin of the prothorax. It
is perforated by a large foramen, through
which the organs of the head are connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>with those of the trunk. It is very distinct in Hydroüs
and most Coleoptera, and in some, the Staphylinidæ, Carabidæ, and
Silphidæ is constricted and extended backwards so as to form a complete
neck.” (See also p. 51.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The tentorium.</b>—The walls of
the head are supported or braced
within by two beams or endosternites
passing inwards, and forming
a solid chitinous process or loop
which extends in the cockroach
downwards and forwards from
the lower edge of the occipital
foramen. “In front it gives off
two long crura or props, which
pass to the ginglymus, and are
reflected thence upon the inner
surface of the clypeus, ascending
as high as the antennary socket,
round which they form a kind of
rim.” (Miall and Denny.) The
œsophagus passes upwards between
its anterior crura, the long
flexor of the mandible lies on
each side of the central plate;
the supraœsophageal ganglion
rests on the plate above, and the
subœsophageal ganglion lies below
it, the nerve cords which
unite the two passing through
the circular aperture. (Miall and
Denny.) In Coleoptera (Hydroüs)
it protects the nervous
cord which passes under it.

<p class='c007'>In Anabrus the tentorium is <span class='mono'>V</span>-shaped,
the two arms originating
on each side of the base of the clypeus next to the base of each mandible
the origin being indicated by two small foramina partly concealed
externally and passing inwards and backwards and uniting just before
reaching the posterior edge of the large occipital foramen (Fig. 33).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Palmén regards the tentorium as representing a pair of tracheæ (with the
cephalic spiracles) which have become modified for supports or for muscular
attachment, since he finds that in Ephemera the tentorium breaks across the
middle during exuviation, each half being drawn out of the head like the chitinous
lining of a tracheal tube. This view is supported by Wheeler, who has
shown that the tentorium of Doryphora originates from five pairs of invaginations
of the longitudinal commissures, and which are anterior to those of the
second maxillary segment. “These invaginations grow inwards as slender
tubes, which anastomose in some places. Their lumina are ultimately filled
with chitin.” (Jour. Morph., iii, p. 368.)</p>

<p class='c013'>This view has also been held by Carrière and Cholodkowsky, but Heymons
concludes from his embryological studies on Forficula and Blattidæ (1895) that
it is unfounded. That this is probably the case is proved by the fact that the
apodemes of the thoracic region are evidently not modified tracheæ, since the
stigmata and tracheæ are present.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Number of segments in the head.</b>—While it is taken for granted
by many entomologists that the head of insects represents a single
segment, despite the circumstance that it bears four pairs of appendages,
the more careful, philosophical observers have recognized the
fact that it is composed of more than a single segment. Burmeister
recognized only two segments in the head; Carus and Audouin recognized
three; Macleay and Newman four; Straus-Durckheim even so
many as seven. Huxley supposed that there are five segments bearing
appendages, remarking, “if the eyes be taken to represent the
appendages of another somite, the insect head will contain six
somites.” (Manual of Anat. Invert. Animals, p. 398.)</p>

<p class='c007'>These discordant views were based on the examination of the head
in adult insects; but if we confine ourselves to the imago alone, it is
impossible to arrive at a solution of the problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>Newport took a step in the right direction when he wrote: “It
is only by comparing the distinctly indicated parts of the head in
the perfect insect with similar ones in the larva that we can hope to
ascertain the exact number of segments of which it is composed.”
He then states that in the head of <i>Hydroüs piceus</i> are the remains
of four segments, though still in the next paragraph, when speaking
of the head as a whole, he considers it as the first segment, “while,”
he adds, “the aggregation of segments of which it is composed we
shall designate individually <i>subsegments</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That the head of insects is composed of four segments was shown
on embryological grounds by the writer (1871) and afterwards by
Graber (1879). The antennæ and mouth-parts are outgrowths budding
out from the four primitive segments of the head; the antennæ
grow out from the under side of the procephalic lobes, and these
should therefore receive the name of antennal lobes. In like manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the mandibles and first and second maxillæ arise respectively from
the three succeeding segments.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While the postoral segments and their appendages are readily
seen to be four in number, the question arises as to whether the eyes
represent the appendages of one or more preoral segments. In this
case embryology thus far has not afforded clear, indubitable evidence.
We are therefore obliged to rely on the number of neuromeres,
or primitive ganglia. In the postoral region of the head,
as also in the trunk, a pair of neuromeres
correspond to each segment. (See also under
Nervous System, and under Embryology.)
We therefore turn to the primitive number
of neuromeres constituting the procephalic
lobes or brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the researches of Patten, Viallanes,
and of Wheeler, especially of Viallanes, it
appears that the brain or supraœsophageal
ganglion is divided into three primitive segments.
(See Nervous System, Brain.) The
antennæ are innervated from the middle division
or deutocerebrum. Hence the ocular
segment, <i>i.e.</i> that bearing the compound and
simple eyes, is supposed to represent the first
segment of the head. This, however, does
not involve the conclusion that the eyes are
the homologues of the limbs, however it may
be in the Crustacea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second head-segment is the antennal,
the antennæ being the first pair of true
jointed appendages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third segment of the head is very
obscurely indicated, and the facts in proof
of its existence are scanty and need farther elucidation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Viallanes’ tritocerebral lobes or division of the brain is situated
in a segment found by Wheeler to be intercalated between the antennal
and mandibular segments. He also detected in <i>Anurida
maritima</i>, the rudiments of a pair of appendages, smaller than those
next to it, and which soon disappear (Fig. 34, <i>tc. ap</i>). He calls this
segment the intercalary.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Heymons (1895) designates it as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Vorkiefersegment,” and it may thus be termed the premandibular
segment.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As early as 1870 Bütschli observed in the embryo of the honey
bee the rudiments of what appeared to be a pair of appendages
between the antennæ and mandibles, but, judging by his figures,
nearer to and more like the mandibles than the rudimentary antennæ
(Fig. 35); they
seemed to him “almost
like a pair of
inner antennæ.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I find,” he says,
“in no other insects
any indication of this
peculiar appendage,
which at the time of
its greatest development
attains a larger
size than the antennæ,
and which, afterwards becoming less distinct, forms by fusion with
that on the other side a sort of larval lower lip. That this appendage
does not belong to the category of segmental appendages is
indicated by the site of its origin on the upper side of the primitive
band.” (Zeitschr. wissen. Zool., xx, p. 538.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Grassi has also observed it in Apis, and regards it as the germ
of a first, but deciduous, pair of jaws. In the embryo of Hylotoma
Graber (Figs. 134, 135) found what he calls three pairs of “preantennal
projections,” one of which he thinks corresponds to the “inner
antennæ” of Bütschli. This subject needs further investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It thus appears that the procephalic lobes of the embryo of insects,
with the rudiments of the antennæ, constitute the primitive
head, and perhaps correspond to the annelidan head, while gradually
the antennal appendages were in the phylogenetic development
of the class fused with the two segments of the primary head. That
the second maxillary segment, the occiput, was the last to be added,
and at first somewhat corresponded in position to the poison-fangs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of centipedes (Chilopods), is shown by our observations on the embryology

</div>

<p class='c007'>The mandibular segment appears to form a large part of the post-antennal
region of the epicranium on account of the great mandibular
muscle which arises from so large an area of
the anterior region of the head (Fig. 37).</p>

<p class='c007'>Judging from the embryo of Nematus (Fig. 37),
the first maxillary segment is tergally aborted, there
being no tergo-pleural portion left.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second maxillary segment tergally appears
to be represented by the occipital region of the
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the gular region, including the submentum
and mentum, probably represents the base of the
labium or second maxillæ.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The so-called “occiput”
forms the base of the
head of Corydalus, a neuropterous
insect, which, however,
is more distinct in the larva.
In most other adult insects the
occiput is either obsolete or
fused with the hinder part of
the epicranium. We have traced the history of
this piece (sclerite) in the embryo of Æschna,
a dragon-fly, and have found that it represents
the tergal portion of the sixth or labial segment.
In our memoir on the development of
this dragon-fly, Pl. 2, Fig. 9, the head of the
embryo is seen to be divided into two regions,
the anterior, formed of the antennal, mandibular, and first maxillary
segments, and the posterior, formed of the sixth or labial segment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>This postoral segment at first appears to be one of the thoracic
segments, but is afterwards added to the head, though not until
after birth, as it is still separate in the freshly hatched nymph
(Fig. 4; see also Kolbe, p. 132, Fig. 59, <i>sq.</i> 5). A. Brandt’s figure
of <i>Calopteryx virgo</i> (Pl. 2, Fig. 19) represents an embryo of a stage
similar to ours, in which the postoral or sixth (labial) segment is
quite separate from the rest of the head. The accompanying figure,
copied from our memoir, also shows in a saw-fly larva (<i>Nematus
ventricosus</i>) the relations of the labial or sixth segment to the rest
of the head. The suture between the labial segment and the preoral
part of the head disappears in adult life. From this sketch it
would seem that the back part of the head, <i>i.e.</i> of the epicranium,
may be made up in part of the tergite or pleurites of the mandibular
segment, since the mandibular muscles are inserted on the roof of
the head behind the eyes. It is this labial segment which in Corydalus
evidently forms the occiput, and of which in most other insects
there is no trace in larval or adult life, unless we except certain
Orthoptera (Locusta), and the larva of the Dyticidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The composition of the head in the Hymenoptera.</b>—Ratzeburg stated
in 1832 that the head in the adult Hymenoptera (Cynips, Hemiteles,
and Formica) does not correspond to that of the larva, but is derived
from the head and the first thoracic segment of the larva. Westwood
and also Goureau made less complete but similar observations,
though Westwood afterwards changed his opinion, and the same
view was maintained by Reinhard. Our own observations (as seen
in Fig. 38) led us to suppose that this was a mistaken view; that
the larval head, being too small to contain that of the semipupa, was
simply pushed forward, as in caterpillars. Bugnion, however, reaffirms
it in such a detailed way that we reproduce his account. He
maintains that the
views of Ratzeburg
are exact and easy to
verify in the chalcid
genus Encyrtus, except,
however, that
which concerns the
ventral part and the
posterior border of
the prothoracic segment.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the time of
transformation approaches,
the head of
the larva, he says, is
depressed and soon
concealed under the
edge of the prothoracic
segment; the latter elongates, becomes thicker and more convex,
and within can be seen the two oculo-cephalic imaginal buds.
The head of the perfect insect is derived not only from the head of
the larva, but also from the portion of the prothoracic segment which
is occupied by the buds, <i>i.e.</i> almost its entire dorsolateral face. But
the hinder and ventral part of this segment (which contains the
imaginal buds of the first pair of legs) takes no part in the formation
of the head; these parts, according to Bugnion, towards the end
of the larval period detaching themselves so as to become fused with
the thorax and constitute the pronotum and the prosternum.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>This mode of formation of the head may be observed still more easily in
Rhodites, Hemiteles, and Microgaster, from the fact that their oculo-cephalic
buds are much more precocious, and that the eyes are charged with pigment at
a period when the insect still preserves its larval form.</p>

<p class='c013'>“... I believe that this mode of formation of the head occurs in all Hymenoptera
with apodous larvæ, in this sense; that a more or less considerable part
of the first thoracic segment is always soldered to the head of the larva to constitute
the head of the perfect insect. The arrangement of the nervous system
is naturally in accord with this peculiarity of development, and the cephalic
ganglia of the larva to which the ocular blastems later adapt themselves, are
found not in the head, but in the succeeding segment (Figs. 39, 40, 41).</p>

<p class='c013'>“Relying on these facts, I maintain that the encroachment of the head on
the prothorax is a consequence of the preponderance in size of the brain, and
indicates the superiority of the Hymenoptera over other insects....”</p>

<p class='c013'>That the pronotum is derived from the larval prothoracic segment is proved
by the fact that the first pair of stigmata becomes what authors call the “prothoracic”
stigmata of the perfect insect. But Bugnion thinks that the projection
which carries it, and which he calls the shoulder (Figs. 41 and 42), belongs
to the mesonotum.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> Appendages of the head</h4>

<p class='c016'><b>The antennæ.</b>—These are organs of tactile sense, but also bear
olfactory, and in some cases auditory organs; they are usually inserted
between or in front of the eyes, and moved by two small
muscles at the base, within the head. In the more generalized
insects the antennæ are simple, many-jointed appendages, the joints
being equal in size and shape. The antennæ articulate with the
head by a ball and socket joint, the part on which it moves being
called the <i>torulus</i> (Fig. 32, <i>r</i>). In the more specialized forms it is
divided into the <i>scape</i>, the <i>pedicel</i>, and a <i>flagellum</i> (or <i>clavola</i>); but
usually, as in ants, wasps, and bees, there are two parts, the basal
three-jointed one being the scape, and the distal one, the usually long
filiform flagellum. The antennæ, especially the flagellum, vary
greatly in form in insects of different families and orders, this variation
being the result of adaptation to their peculiar surroundings and
habits. The number of antennal joints may be one (Articerus, a
clavigerid beetle), or two in Paussus and in <i>Adranes cœcus</i> (Fig. 43<sup>12</sup>),
where they are short and club-shaped; in flies (Muscidæ, etc.), they
are very short and with few joints, and when at rest lying in a cavity
adapted for their reception. In the lamellicorn beetles the flagellum
is divided into several leaves, and this condition may be approached
in the serrate or flabellicorn antennæ of other beetles. In Lepidoptera,
and in certain saw-flies and beetles, they are either pectinate
or bipectinate, being in one case at least, that of the Australian
Hepialid (<i>Abantiades argenteus</i>), tripectinate (Fig. 44), and in the
dipterous (Tachinid) genus Talarocera the third joint is bipectinate
(Fig. 45). In Xenos and in Parnus they may be deeply forked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>while in Otiocerus, two long processes arise from the base, giving it
a trifid shape. In dragon-flies and cicadæ, they are minute and
hair-like, though jointed, while in the larvæ of many metabolous
insects they are reduced to minute three-jointed tubercles. In
aquatic beetles, bugs, etc., the antennæ are short, and often, when
at rest, bent close to the body, as long antennæ would impede
their progress.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Recent examination of the sense-organs in the
antennæ of an ant,
wasp, or bee enables
us, he says, to realize
what wonderful organs
the antennæ are.
In such insects we
have a rod-like tube
which can be folded
up or extended out
into space, containing
the antennal nerve,
which arises directly from the brain and sends a branch to each of
the thousands of olfactory pits or pegs which stud its surface. The
antenna is thus a wonderfully complex organ, and the insect must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>be far more sensitive to movements of the air, to odors, wave-sounds,
and light-waves, than any of the vertebrate animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>That ants appear to communicate with each other, apparently
talking with their antennæ, shows the highly sensitive nature of
these appendages. “The honey-bee when constructing its cells ascertains
their proper direction and size by means of the extremities
of these organs.” (Newport.)</p>

<p class='c007'>How dependent insects are upon their antennæ is seen when we
cut them off. The insect is at once seriously affected, its central
nervous system receiving a great shock, while it gives no such sign
of distress and loss of mental power when we remove the palpi or
legs. On depriving a bee of its antennæ, it falls helpless and partially
paralyzed to the earth, is unable at first to walk, but on partly
recovering the use of its limbs, it still has lost the power of coördinating
its movements, nor can it sting; in a few minutes, however, it
becomes able to feebly walk a few steps, but it remains over an hour
nearly motionless. Other insects after similar treatment are not so
deeply affected, though bees, wasps, ants, moths, certain beetles, and
dragon-flies are at first more or less stunned and confused.</p>

<p class='c007'>The antennæ afford salient secondary sexual differences, as seen
in the broadly pectinated antennæ of male bombycine moths, certain
saw-flies (Lophyrus), and many other insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mouth-parts, buccal appendages, or trophi, comprise, besides
the labrum, the mandibles and maxillæ.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The mandibles.</b>—These are true jaws, adapted for cutting, tearing,
or crushing the food, or for defence, while in the bees they are used
as tools for modelling in wax, and in Cetonia, etc., as a brush for
collecting pollen. They are usually opposed to each other at the
tips, but in many carnivorous forms their tips cross each other like
shears. They are situated below the clypeus on each side, and are
hinged to the head by a true ginglymus articulation, consisting of
two condyles or tubercles to which muscles are attached, the principal
ones being the flexor and great extensor (Fig. 48). They are
solid, chitinous, of varied shapes, and in the form of the teeth those
of the same pair differ somewhat from each other (Fig. 46 <i>A</i>). In
the pollen-eating beetles (Cetoniæ) and in the dung-beetles (Aphodius,
etc.) the edge is soft and flexible. In the males of Lucanus, etc.
(Fig. 47), and of Corydalus (Fig. 29), they are of colossal size, and
are large and sabre-shaped in the larvæ of water-beetles, ant-lions,
Chrysopa, etc. where they are perforated at the tips, through which
the blood of their prey is sucked.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the mandibles are generally regarded as composed of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>single piece, in Campodea and Machilis there appears to be an
additional basal piece apparently corresponding to the stipes of the
first maxilla, and separated by a faint suture from the molar or
distal joint. In Campodea there is a minute movable appendage
figured both by Meinert and by Nassonow,
which appears to represent the lacinia of the
maxilla (Fig. 48). Wood-Mason has observed
in the mandibles of the embryo of a Javanese
cockroach, <i>Blatta (Panesthia) javanica</i>, indications
of “the same number of joints as in
that of chilognathous myriopods, or one less
than in that of Machilis.” Also he adds:
“In both ‘larvæ’ and adults of <i>Panesthia
javanica</i> a faint groove crosses the ‘back’ of
the mandible at the base. This groove appears to be the remains of
the joint between the third and apical segments of the formerly
4–segmented mandibles.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He also refers to the <i>prostheca</i> of Kirby and Spence (Fig. 49),
which he thinks appears to be a mandibular lacinia homologous with
it in Staphylinidæ and other beetles (J. B. Smith also considers it
as “homologous to the lacinia of the maxilla”), and on examining
it in <i>P. cornutus</i> and a Nicaragua species (Fig. 49), we adopt his view,
since we have found that it is freely movable and attached by a
tendon and muscle to the galea. In the rove beetles (Goërius, Staphylinus,
etc.) and in the subaquatic Heteroceridæ, instead of a molar
process, is a membranous setose appendage not unlike the coxal
appendages of Scolopendrella, movably articulated to the jaw, which
he thinks answers to the molar branch of the jaws in Blatta and
Machilis. “It has its homologue in the diminutive Trichopterygidæ
in the firmly chitinized quadrant-shaped second
mandibular joint, which is used in a peculiar
manner in crushing the food”; also in the movable
tooth of the Passalidæ, and
in the membranous inner
lobe of the mandibles of
the goliath-beetles, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. B. Smith has clearly
shown that the mandibles
are compound in certain of
the lamellicorns. In <i>Copris
carolina</i> (Fig. 50), he says,
the small membranous
mandibles are divided into
a basal piece (basalis), the
homologue of the stipes in the maxilla; another of the basal pieces
he calls the molar, and this is the equivalent of the subgalea, while
a third sclerite, only observed in Copris, is the <i>conjunctivus</i>, the
lacinia (prostheca) being well developed. Smith therefore concludes
“that the structure of the mandible is fundamentally the
same as that of the labium and maxilla, and that we have an equally
complex organ in point of origin. Its usual function, however,
demands a powerful and solid structure, and the sclerites are in
most instances as thoroughly chitinized and so closely united to
the others that practically there is only a single piece, in which the
homology is obscured.” (Trans. Amer. Ent. Soc., xix, pp. 84, 85.
1892.) From the studies of Smith and our observations on Staphylinus,
Passalus, Phanæus, etc. (Fig. 50, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>) we fully agree with
the view that the mandibles are primarily 3–lobed appendages like
the maxillæ. Nymphal Ephemerids have a lacinia-like process.

<p class='c007'>Mandibles are wanting in the adults of the more specialized Lepidoptera,
being vestigial in the most generalized forms (certain
Tineina and Crambus), but well developed in that very primitive
moth, Eriocephala (Fig. 51). They are also completely atrophied in
the adult Trichoptera, though very large and functional in the pupa
of these insects (Fig. 52), as also in the pupa of Micropteryx (Fig. 53).
They are also wanting in the imago of male Diptera and in the
females of all flies except Culicidæ and Tabanidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are said by Dr. Horn to be absent in the adult <i>Platypsyllus
castoris</i>, though well developed in the larva; and functional mandibles
are lacking in the Hemiptera.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The first maxillæ.</b>—These highly differentiated appendages are
inserted on the sides of the head just behind the mandibles and the
mouth, and are divided into three lobes, or divisions, which are supported
upon two, and sometimes three basal pieces, <i>i.e.</i> the basal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>joint or <i>cardo</i>, the second joint or <i>stipes</i>, with the <i>palpifer</i>, the latter
present in Termitidæ (Fig. 54, <i>plpgr</i>), but not always separately developed
(Fig. 55). The
cardo varies in shape,
but is more or less triangular
and is usually
wedged in between the
submentum and mandible.
It is succeeded by
the stipes, which usually
forms the support for
the three lobes of the
maxilla, and is more or

<p class='c007'>The palpus is in general antenniform and is composed
of from 1 to 6 joints, being usually 4– or 5–jointed,
and is much longer than the galea. In the maxilla of
the beetle Nemognatha
(Fig. 57), the galea is
greatly elongated,
the two together
forming
an imperfect tube
or proboscis and
reminding one of
the tongue of a
moth, while the
lacinia is reduced. In the Mecoptera the lacinia and
galea are closely similar (Fig. 58); in the
Trichoptera only one of the lobes is present
(Fig. 59), while in the Lepidoptera
the galea unites with its mate to form the
so-called tongue (Fig. 60). The maxilla
of the male of <i>Tegeticula yuccasella</i> is
normal, though the galeæ are separate;
but in the female, what Smith regards as
the palpifer (the “tentacle” of Riley) is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>remarkably developed, being nearly as long as

<p class='c007'>It now seems most probable that in the first maxillæ we have the
primary form of buccal appendage of insects, the appendage being
composed of three basal pieces with three variously modified distal
lobes or divisions; and that the mandibles and second maxillæ are
modifications of this
type.</p>

<p class='c007'>How wonderfully
the maxillæ of the
Lepidoptera are
modified, and the
peculiar shapes assumed
in the Diptera,
Hymenoptera,
and other groups,
will be stated in the
accounts of those
orders, but it is well
to recall the fact
that in the most
primitive and generalized
moth, Eriocephala,
the lacinia
is well developed
(Fig. 64).</p>

<p class='c007'>As Newport remarks,
the office of
the maxillæ in the
mandibulate insects
is of a twofold
kind; since they are
adapted not only for
seizing and retaining the food in the mouth, but also as accessory
jaws, since they aid the mandibles in comminuting it before it is
passed on to the pharynx and swallowed. Hence, as the food varies
so much in nature and situation, it will be readily seen that the
maxillæ, especially their distal parts, vary correspondingly. Thus
far no close observations on the exact use of the first and second
maxillæ have been published.</p>

<p class='c007'>The palpi also are not only organs of touch, but in some cases
act as hands and also bear minute sense-organs, the function
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of which is unknown, but would appear to be usually that of
smell.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The second maxillæ.</b>—The “under-lip” or labium of insects is
formed by the fusion at the basal portion of what in the embryo are
separate appendages, and which
arise in the same manner as the
first maxillæ. They are invariably
solidly united, no cases of partial
or incomplete fusion being known.
The so-called labium is situated
in front of the gula or gular region,
and is bounded on each side by
the gena, or cheek. As already
observed, the second maxillæ appear
to be the appendages of the
last or occipital segment of the
head.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second maxillæ are very
much differentiated
and vary
greatly in the different orders, being especially
modified in the haustellate or suctorial orders,
notably the Hymenoptera and Diptera. In the
mandibulate orders, particularly the Orthoptera,
where they are most generalized and primitive in
shape and structure, they consist of the following
parts: the <i>gula</i> (a <i>postgula</i> is present in Dermaptera),
<i>submentum</i> (lora of Cheshire, i, p. 91), <i>mentum</i>,
<i>palpifer</i>, the latter bearing the <i>palpi</i>; the
<i>lingua</i> (<i>ligula</i>) and <i>paraglossæ</i>, while the hypopharynx
or lingua is situated on the upper side.
The labial palpi are of the same general shape as
those of the first maxillæ, but shorter, with very
rarely more than three joints, though in Pteronarcys
there are four. Leon has detected vestigial
labial palpi in several Hemiptera (Fig. 73). As
to the exact nature and limits of the gula, we
are not certain; it is not always present, and may
be only a differentiation of the submentum, or the
latter piece may be regarded as a part of the gula.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are disposed to consider the second maxillæ as morphologically
nearly the exact equivalents of the first pair of maxillæ, and if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>adopt this view it will greatly simplify our conception of the real
nature of this complicated organ. The object of the fusion of the
basal portion appears to be to form an under-lip, in order both to
prevent the food from falling backwards out of the mouth, and, with
the aid of the first pair of maxillæ, to pass it forward to be crushed
between the mandibles, the two sets of appendages acting somewhat
as the tongue of vertebrates to carry and arrange or press the morsels
of food between the teeth or cutting edges of the mandibles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spines often present on the free inner edges of the first and
second maxillæ (Figs. 54, 62) form rude combs which seem to clean
the antennæ, etc., often aiding the tibial combs in this operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The submentum and mentum, or the mentum when no submentum
is differentiated (with the gula, when present), appear to be collectively
homologous with the cardines of the first pair of maxillæ, together
with the palpifers and the stipites.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> These pieces are more or
less square, and have a slightly marked median suture in Termitidæ,
the sign of primitive fusion or coalescence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most primitive form of the second maxillæ occurs in the Orthoptera
and in the Termitidæ. The palpifer is either single (Periplaneta,
Diapheromera, Gryllidæ) or double (<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, Locustidæ).
In Prisopus the single piece in front of the palpifer is in other
forms divided, each half (Blatta, Locustidæ, Acrydidæ) bearing the
two “paraglossæ,” which appendages in reality are the homologues
of the lacinia and galea of the first maxillæ.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> In the Termitidæ (Fig.
65) the lingua is not differentiated from the palpifer, and the two
paraglossæ (or the lamina externa and interna of some authors)
with the palpus are easily seen to be the homologues of the three
lobes of the first maxillæ. In the Perlidæ (Pteronarcys, Fig. 66)
the palpifer is divided, while the four paraglossæ arise, as in Prisopus
and Anisomorpha, from an undivided piece, the lingua not being
visible from without. In the Neuroptera the lingua or ligula is a
large, broad, single lobe, without “paraglossæ,” and the palpifer is
either single (Myrmeleon, Fig. 67), or divided (Mantispa, Fig. 68).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>In Corydalus (Fig. 29) the palpifer forms a single piece, and the
lingua is undivided, though lobed on the free edge.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the metabolic orders above the Neuroptera the lingua is variously
modified, or specialized, with no vestiges of the lacinia or

found a minute free galea, <i>me</i>, and an

<p class='c007'><b>The hypopharynx.</b>—While in its most
generalized condition, as in Synaptera,
Dermaptera, Orthoptera, and Neuroptera,
this anterior median fold or outgrowth
of the labium forming the floor
of the mouth may retain the designation
of “tongue,” lingua, or ligula; in its
more specialized form, particularly when
used as a piercing or lapping organ, the
use of the name <i>hypopharynx</i> seems most
desirable. And this is especially the
case since, like the epipharynx, it is
morphologically a median structure, and
while the epipharynx forms the soft,
sensitive roof of the mouth, or pharynx;
its opposite, the hypopharynx, rises as
a fold from the floor of the mouth, forming
in its most generalized condition a specialized fold of the buccal
integument. In certain cases, as in the honey-bee, the very long
slender “tongue” or hypopharynx is evidently, as in the case of
the epipharynx, a highly sensitive armature of the mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>In all insects this organ—whether forming a soft, tongue-like,
anterior portion or fold of the labium, and “continuous with the
lower wall of the pharynx,” or a hard, piercing, awl-like appendage
(fleas and flies), or a long, slender, hairy or setose, trough-like structure
like the “tongue” of the honey-bee—has a definite location at
the end and on the upper side of the labium, and serves to receive
at its base the external opening of the salivary duct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypopharynx, as well shown in its lingua condition in Orthoptera,
is continuous with and forms the anterior part or fold of
the base of the coalesced second maxillæ. It does not seem to be
paired, or to represent a pair of appendages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opinion regarding the homology of this unpaired piercing organ
is by no means settled, and while there is a general agreement as to
the nature of the paired mouth-parts, recent observers differ very
much as to the morphology of the organ in question.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the langue or <i>lingua</i> of Savigny (1816), the <i>ligula</i> of Kirby
and Spence (1828), the <i>langue ou languette</i> (<i>lancette médiane du suçoir</i>)
of Dugès (1832), the <i>lingua</i> of Westwood (Class, ins., ii, p. 489, 1840),
“the unpaired median piercing organ” (“the analogon of the epipharynx
of Diptera”) of Karsten (1864), the “tongue” of Taschenberg
(1880).</p>

<p class='c007'>The name <i>hypopharynx</i> was first proposed by Savigny in 1816,
who, after naming the membranous plate which has for its base the
upper side of the pharynx, the <i>epipharynx</i>, remarks: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans quelques
genres, notamment dans les Eucères, le bord inférieur de ce même
pharynx donne naissance à un autre appendice plus solide que le
précédent, et qui s’emboîte avec lui. Je donnerai à ce dernier le
nom de <i>langue</i> ou d’<i>hypopharynx</i>. Voilà donc la bouche des Hyménoptères
composée de quatre organes impaires, sans y comprendre la
ganache ou le menton; savoir, la lèvre supérieure, l’épipharynx,
l’hypopharynx, et la lèvre inférieure, et de deux organes paires, les
mandibules et les mâchoires.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>As stated by Dimmock: “The hypopharynx is usually present in
Diptera (according to Menzbier absent in Sargus), and contains a tube,
opening by a channel on its upper surface; this channel extends
back, more or less, from the tip, and is the outlet for the salivary
secretion. The tip of the hypopharynx may be naked and used as
a lance (Hæmatopota, according to Menzbier), or may be hairy
(Musca). The upper side of the base of the hypopharynx is
continuous with the lower wall of the pharynx; its under surface
may entirely coalesce with the labium (Culex, male), may join
the labium more or less, anterior to the month (Musca), or, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>either mandibles or maxillæ are present, its base may join them
(Culex, female).” (p. 43.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We will now briefly describe the lingua, first of the mandibulate
or biting insects, and then its specialized form, the hypopharynx of
the haustellate and lapping insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lingua (hypopharynx) exists in
perhaps its most generalized condition
in the Thysanura (Fig. 69), where it
forms a soft projection, having the same
relations as in Anabrus and other Orthoptera.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the cockroach (Fig. 70), as stated
by Miall and Denny, the lingua is a
chitinous fold of the oral integument
situated in front of the labium, and lying
in the cavity of the mouth. The
common duct of the salivary glands
enters the lingua, and opens on its
hinder surface. The lingua is supported
by a chitinous skeleton (Figs. 70, <i>B</i>; 82,
<i>shp</i>). “The thin chitinous surface of the
lingua is hairy, like other parts of the
mouth, and stiffened by special chitinous rods or bands.” (Miall
and Denny.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Acrydiidæ (<i>Melanoplus femur-rubrum</i>) the tongue is a large,
membranous, partly hollow
expansion of the base of the
labium. It may be exposed
by depressing the end of the
labium, when the opening of
the salivary duct may be seen
at the bottom or end of the
space or gap between the
hinder base of the tongue,
and the inner anterior base of
the labium, as shown by the
arrows in Fig. 70. It is somewhat pyriform, slightly keeled above,
and bearing fine stiff bristles, which, as they point more or less
inwards, probably aid in retaining the food within the mouth. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>base of the tongue is narrow, and extends back to near the pharynx,
there being on the floor of the mouth, behind the tongue, two oblique,
slight ridges, covered with stiff, golden-yellow hairs, like those on
the tongue. The opening of the salivary duct is situated on the
under or hinder side of the hypopharynx,
between it and the base of the labium, the
base of the former being cleft; the hollow
thus formed is situated over the opening,
and forms the salivary receptacle.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Locustidæ (Anabrus, Fig. 71) the
tongue (hypopharynx) is a broad, somewhat
flattened lobe arising from the upper
part of the base of the mentum and behind
the palpifer. This lobe is cavernous underneath,
the hollow being the salivary
receptacle (<i>sr</i>); the latter is situated over
the opening of the salivary duct, which is
placed between the base of both the hypopharynx
and the labium. The salivary
fluid apparently has to pass up and around on each side of the hypopharynx
in order to mix with the food.</p>

<p class='c007'>These relations in the Orthoptera are also the same in the
Perlidæ, where the hypopharynx is well developed, forming an
unusually large tongue-like mass, nearly filling the buccal cavity.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Odonata the lingua is a small, rounded lobe, as also in the
Ephemeridæ; in the nymph, however, of Heptagenia (Fig. 72) it is
highly developed, according
to Vayssière, who seems inclined
to regard it as representing
a pair of appendages.
The tongue in Hemiptera is
said by Léon to be present in
<i>Benacus griseus</i> (Say) and to
correspond to the subgalea of
Brullé or hypodactyle of Audouin
(Fig. 73), but this appears
to correspond to the labium proper, rather than a true lingua,
the latter not being differentiated in this order. In the Coleoptera
the lingua is rather small. In beetles, as Anopthalmus (Fig. 74), it
forms a setose lobe; and a well-developed nerve, the lingual nerve,
passes to it, dividing at the end into several branches (<i>n-l</i>). In Sialis
the lingua is short, much less developed than usual, being rounded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and bears on the edge what appear to be numerous taste-hairs, like
those on the ends of the maxillary and labial palpi.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larval Trichoptera the
spinneret is well developed, and
in structure substantially like
that of caterpillars, and it is
plainly the homologue of the
hypopharynx, receiving as it
does the end of the silk-duct.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the adult Trichoptera the
hypopharynx is a very large,
tongue-like, fleshy outgrowth,
and is, both in situation and
structure, since
it contains the
opening of the
silk-duct, exactly
homologous
with the hypopharynx
of insects
of other
orders, being somewhat intermediate
between the fleshy
tongue or lingua of the mandibulate
insects, especially the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Neuroptera, and the hypopharynx of the bees (Fig. 86). Lucas
describes and figures it under the name of “haustellum,” but does
not homologize it with the hypopharynx. The caddis-flies have been
observed to drink water and take in both fluid and fine particles
of solid food, and to use the haustellum
for this purpose, the end being provided
with minute sense-organs like
those on the first maxillary lacinia, and
possibly of a gustatory nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spinneret of the larvæ of Lepidoptera
is evidently the homologue of
the hypopharynx of insects of other
orders. It will be seen that the homology
of the different parts is identical,
the common duct of the silk-glands
opening at the end of the hypopharynx,
which here forms a complete
tube or proboscis extending beyond the
end of the labium, in adaptation to its
use as a spinning organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walter refers to Burgess’s discovery
of a hypopharynx in <i>Danais archippus</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>remarking that this organ in the adult Eriocephalidæ (Fig. 76)
exhibits a great similarity to the relations observable in the lower
insects, adding:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The furrow is here within coalesced with the inner side of the
labium, and though I see in the entire structure of the head the
inner edge of the ligula tube
extended under the epipharynx
as far as the mandible, I must
also accept the fact that here
also the hypopharynx extends to
the mouth-opening as in all other
sucking insects with a well-developed
under-lip, viz. the Diptera
and Hymenoptera.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He has also discovered in
Micropteryx a paired structure
which he regards as the hypopharynx
(Fig. 77). As he states:</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 78.</span>—Hypopharynx (<i>hph</i>) of Danais: <i>cl</i>, clypeus; <i>sd</i>, salivary duct; <i>m</i>, labial palp muscles; <i>fm</i>, frontal muscle; <i>ph</i>, pharynx; <i>cor</i>, cornea.—After Burgess.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“A portion of the inner surface
of the tube-like ligula is
covered by a furrow-like band which, close to the inner side, is
coalesced with it, and in position, shape, as well as its appendages
or teeth on the edge, may be
regarded as nothing else than
the hypopharynx.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A hypopharynx is also present
in the highest Lepidoptera,
Burgess having detected it in
<i>Danais archippus</i>. He states
that the hypopharynx forms
the floor of the pharyngeal
cavity; “it is convex on each
side of a median furrow (Fig.
78, <i>hph</i>) and somewhat resembles
in shape the human breast.
The convex areas are dotted over with little papillæ, which possibly
may be taste-organs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a piercing organ the hypopharynx reaches its greatest development
in the Siphonaptera and Diptera, where the chitinous parts are
greatly hypertrophied, the fleshy tongue-like portion so developed in
the mandibulate orders being greatly reduced. The chitinous parts are
alike on each side of the median organ, being bilaterally symmetrical.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fleas the hypopharynx is a large, slender, unpaired, long,
chitinous trough, as long as the mandibles, and toothed at the end.
Figures 79 and 80 show its relations to the other parts of the mouth;
in Fig. 79, <i>x</i>, is seen where the salivary duct opens into the pharynx.
Although this organ is not unanimously referred to the hypopharynx,
yet from the description of Landois and others, it is evident that
this structure does not correspond to the labrum or epipharynx, but
belongs to or arises from the floor of the mouth, and, being in close
relation to the labium, and also receiving the salivary duct, must be
a true hypopharynx.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>In the Diptera the hypopharynx reaches its highest development
as a large, stout, awl-like structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meinert, in his detailed and elaborately illustrated work, Trophi
Dipterorum (1881), has made an advance on our knowledge of the
hypopharynx and its homologies, both by his evidently faithful descriptions
and dissections, and by his admirably clear figures.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The hypopharynx, a continuation of the lower
edge (<i>lamina</i>) of the pharynx, most generally free,
more or less produced, acute anteriorly, forms with
the labrum the tube of the pump (<i>antliæ</i>). (The hypopharynx
when obsolete, or coalesced with the canal of
the proboscis, is the <i>theca</i>; in such a case the siphon
or tube is formed by the theca and labrum.) Meanwhile
the hypopharynx, the largest of all the trophi
(<i>omnium trophorum maximus</i>), constitutes the chief
piercing organ (<i>telum</i>) of Diptera. The hypopharynx
is moved by protractor, most generally quite or very
powerful, and by retractor muscles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The efferent duct of the thoracic salivary glands
(<i>ductus salivalis</i>) perforates the hypopharynx, more
or less near the base, that the saliva may be ejected
through the canal into the wound, or that it may be
conducted along the labella. Very rarely the salivary
duct, perforating the hypopharynx, is continued in
the shape of a free, very slender tube.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The salivary duct behind the base of the hypopharynx
forms the receptacle or <i>receptaculum</i>, provided
with retractor and levator muscles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been carefully studied by Meinert in
a species of Culex (Fig. 81), Simulium (Fig.
82), Tabanus (Fig. 83), and in Asilus (Fig. 84),
where it is seen to attain enormous proportions. In the Hymenoptera,
this organ in its most specialized condition is a trough-like
rod, adapted for lapping nectar (Fig. 85, 86, <i>hyp</i>). The
tongue or hypopharynx of the honey-bee has been elaborately described
by Cheshire in his Bees and Bee Keeping.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> He calls it
the tongue or ligula. It is situated in a tube formed by the maxillæ
and labial palpi, and can be partially retracted into the mentum.
He states that it can move up and down in the tube thus formed,
and then describes it as covered by a hairy sheath, its great elasticity
being due to a rod running through its centre enabling it to be used
as a lapping tongue. The sheath</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“passes round the tongue to the back, where its edges do not meet, but are
continuous with a very thin plaited membrane (<i>G</i>, <i>pm</i>) covered with minute hairs.
This membrane, after passing towards the sides of the tongue, returns to the
angle of the nucleus, or rod, over the under surface of which it is probably continued.
The rod passes through the tongue from end to end, gradually tapering
towards its extremity, and is best studied in the queen, where I trace many
nerve threads and cells.
It is undoubtedly endowed
with voluntary
movement, and must
be partly muscular,
although I have failed
completely in getting
any evidence of striation.
The rod on the
underside has a gutter,
or trough-like hollow
(<i>cd</i>, the central duct)
which is formed into a
pseudotube (false tube)
by intercrossing of
black hairs. It will
also be seen that, by
the posterior meeting
of the sheath, the space
between the folded
membrane (<i>G</i>, <i>sd</i>) becomes
two pseudotubes
of larger size, which I
shall call the side ducts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“These central and
side ducts run down to
that part of the tongue
where the spoon, or
bouton (<i>K</i>, Fig. 86)
is placed. This is provided
with very delicate
split hairs (<i>b</i>, Fig. 86)
capable of brushing up
the most minute quantity
of nectar, which by
capillarity is at once
transferred by the gathering
hairs (which are
here numerous, long,
and thin) to two side groove-like forms at the back of the bouton, and which
are really the opened-out extremity of the centre and side ducts, assuming,
immediately above the bouton, the form seen in <i>F</i>, Fig. 86. The central duct,
which is only from <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>600</span></span> inch to <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1000</span></span> inch in diameter, because of its smaller
size, and so greater capillary attraction, receives the nectar, if insufficient in
quantity to fill the side ducts. But good honey-yielding plants would bring both
centre and side ducts into requisition. The nectar is sucked up until it reaches
the paraglossæ (<i>pa</i>, <i>B</i>, Fig. 86), which are plate-like in front, but membranous
extensions, like small aprons, behind; and by these the nectar reaches the front
of the tongue, to be swallowed as before described.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Cheshire then settles the question which has been in dispute since
the time of Swammerdam, whether the bee’s tongue is solid or tubular.
He agrees with Wolff that the duct is a trough and not a
tube, and proves it by a satisfactory experiment. He remarks:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Bees have the power, by driving blood into the tongue, of forcing the rod
out from the sheath, and distending the wrinkled membrane so that in section
it appears as at <i>H</i>, Fig. 86, the membrane assuming the form of a pouch, given
in full length at <i>A</i>. It will be seen at once that this disposition of parts abolishes
the side ducts, but brings the central duct to the external surface. The
object of this curious capability on the part of the bee is, in my opinion, to
permit of cleaning away any pollen grains, or other impediment that may collect
in the side ducts. The membrane is greasy in nature, and substances or fluids
can be removed from it as easily as water from polished metal. If, now, the
sides of a needle, previously dipped into clove oil in which rosanilin (magenta)
has been dissolved, so as to stain it strongly red, be touched on the centre of
the rod, the oil immediately enters, and passes rapidly upwards and downwards,
filling the trough.”</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Does the hypopharynx represent a distinct segment?</b>—The facts which
suggest that the hypopharynx may possibly represent a highly modified pair of
appendages, arising from a distinct intermaxillary segment, are these: Heymons
plainly shows that, in the embryo of Lepisma, the hypopharynx originates as a
transverse segment-like fold in front of the 2d maxillary segment, and larger
than it, and though he does not mention it in his text, it appears like the rudiment
of a distinct segment; the hypopharynx of Ephemeridæ; arises and remains
separate in the nymph from the labium (see Heymons’ Fig. 29, and there are
two lateral projections; see also Fig. 72, and Vayssiere’s view that it may
represent a pair of appendages; Kolbe also regards it as representing a third
pair of maxillæ, his endolabium, p. 213). Though what is called an unpaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>organ, it is composed of, or supported by, two bilaterally symmetrical styles,
both in Myriopods (Fig. 6, labiella, <i>stil</i>) and in insects (Fig. 77, etc.). On the
other hand, in the embryo of pterygote insects, an intermaxillary segment has
not been yet detected.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE THORAX AND ITS APPENDAGES</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The thorax; its external anatomy</h4>

<p class='c016'>The middle region of the body is called the thorax, and in general
consists of three segments, which are respectively named the <i>prothorax</i>,
<i>mesothorax</i>, and <i>metathorax</i> (Figs. 88, 89, 98).</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 88.</span>—External anatomy of <i>Melanoplus spretus</i>, the head and thorax disjointed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The thorax contains the muscles of flight and those of the legs,
besides the fore intestine (œsophagus and proventriculus), as well as,
in the winged insects, the salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>In the more generalized
orders, notably
the Orthoptera, the
three segments are
distinct and readily
identified.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id047'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 89.</span>—Locust, Melanoplus, side view, with the thorax separated from the head and abdomen, and divided into its three segments.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Each segment consists
of the <i>tergum</i>,
<i>pleurum</i>, and <i>sternum</i>.
In the prothorax these
pieces are not subdivided,
except the
pleural; in such case
the tergum is called
the <i>pronotum</i>. The
prothorax is very
large in the Orthoptera
and other generalized
forms, as also
in the Coleoptera, but
small and reduced in
the Diptera and Hymenoptera.
In the
winged forms the
tergum of the mesothorax
is differentiated
into four pieces
or plates (sclerites).
These pieces were
named by Audouin,
passing from before
backwards, the <i>præscutum</i>,
<i>scutum</i>, <i>scutellum</i>,
and <i>postscutellum</i>.
In the nymph stage
and in the wingless
adults of insects such
as the Mallophaga,
the true lice, the
wingless Diptera, ants, etc., these parts by disuse and loss of the
wings are not differentiated. It is therefore apparent that their
development depends on that of the muscles of flight, of which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>form the base of attachment. The scutum is invariably present, as
is the scutellum. The former in nearly all insects constitutes the
larger part of the tergum, while the latter is, as its name implies, the
small shield-shaped piece
directly behind the scutum.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The præscutum and postscutellum
are usually minute
and crowded down out
of sight between the opposing
segments. As seen in
Fig. 90, the præscutum of
most moths (Telea) is a
small rounded piece, bent
vertically down so as not
to be seen from above. In
Polystœchotes and also in
Hepialus the præscutum is
large, well-developed, triangular,
and wedged in
between the two halves of
the scutum. The postscutellum is still smaller, usually forming a
transverse ridge, and is rarely used in taxonomy.</p>

<div  class='figright id028'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The metathorax is usually smaller and shorter than the mesothorax,
being proportioned to
the size of the wings. In
certain Neuroptera and in
Hepialidæ and some tineoid
moths, where the
hind wings are nearly as
large as those of the
anterior pair, the metathorax
is more than half
or nearly two-thirds as
large as the mesothorax.
In Hepialidæ the præscutum
is large and distinct,
while the scutum is divided
into two widely
separated pieces. The
postscutellum is nearly or quite obsolete.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pleurum in each of the three thoracic segments is divided
into two pieces; the one in front is called the <i>episternum</i>, since it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>rests upon the sternum; the other is the <i>epimerum</i>. To these pieces,
with the sternum in part, the legs are articulated (Fig. 89).</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the episterna is situated the breastplate or <i>sternum</i>,
which is very large in the more primitive forms, as the Orthoptera,
and is small in the Diptera and Hymenoptera.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The episterna and epimera are in certain groups, Neuroptera, etc.,
further subdivided each into two pieces (Fig. 102). The smaller
pieces, hinging upon each other and forming the attachments of the
muscles of flight, differ much in shape and size in insects of different
orders. The difference in shape and degree of differentiation of these
parts of the thorax is mentioned and illustrated under each order,
and reference to the figures will obviate pages of tedious description.
A glance, however, at the thorax of a moth, fly, or bee, where these
numerous pieces are agglutinated into a globular mass, will show
that the spherical shape of the thorax in these insects is due to the
enlargement of one part at the expense of another; the prothoracic
and metathoracic segments being more or less atrophied, while the
mesothorax is greatly enlarged to support the powerful muscles of
flight, the fore wings being much larger than those appended to the
metathorax. In the Diptera, whose hinder
pair of wings are reduced to the condition of
halteres, the reduction of the metathorax
as well as prothorax is especially marked
(Fig. 91).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The patagia.</b>—On each side of the pronotum
of Lepidoptera are two transversely
oval, movable, concavo-convex, erectile plates,
called <i>patagia</i> (Fig. 92). On cutting those of
a dry Catocala in two, they will be seen to be
hollow. Cholodkowsky<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> states that they are
filled with blood and tracheal branches; and
he went so far as to regard them as rudimentary
prothoracic wings, in which view he
was corrected by Haase,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> who compares them
with the tegulæ, regarding them also as secondary or accessory
structures.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The tegulæ.</b>—On the mesothorax are the <i>tegulæ</i> of Kirby (<i>pterygodes</i>
of Latreille, <i>paraptera</i> of McLeay, <i>hypoptère</i> or <i>squamule</i>), which
cover the base of the fore wings, and are especially developed in the
Lepidoptera (Fig. 90, <i>A</i>, <i>t</i>) and in certain Hymenoptera (Fig. 95, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The external opening of the spiracles just under the fore wings, is
situated in a little plate called by Audouin the <i>peritreme</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the higher or aculeate Hymenoptera, besides the three segments
normally composing the thorax, the basal abdominal segment is
during the change from the larva to the pupa transferred to this
region, making four segments. This first abdominal is called “the
median segment” (Figs. 93–95). In such a case the term <i>alitrunk</i>
has been applied to this region, <i>i.e.</i> the thorax, as thus constituted.
Latreille wrongly stated that in the Diptera the first abdominal
segment also entered into the composition of the thorax; but Brauer
has fully disproved that view, as may be seen by an examination of
his sketches which we have copied (Fig. 94).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The apodemes.</b>—The thorax is
supported within by beam-like
processes, or <i>apodemes</i>, which pass inward and also form attachments
for the muscles. Those passing up from the sternum
form the <i>entothorax</i> of Audouin,
and the process of each thoracic
segment is called respectively
the <i>antefurca</i>, <i>medifurca</i>, and
<i>postfurca</i>. In the Orthoptera
(Caloptenus and Anabrus), the
antefurca is large, thin, flattened,
directed forward, and bounds
each side of the prothoracic
ganglion. In the Coleoptera two plates (Fig. 97, 2.<i>s</i>) arise from the
inside of the sternum and “form a collar or leave a circular hole
between them for the passage of the nervous cord” (Newport).
The medifurca is a pair of flat processes which diverge and
bridge the commissure, while the postfurca is situated under the
commissure. In beetles (Dyticus) Newport states that it is expanded
into two broad plates, to which the muscles of the posterior
legs are attached. Graber also notices in the mole cricket
between the apodemes of the meso- and metathorax, a flattened
spine (Fig. 98, <i>do</i>) with two
perforations through which
pass the commissures connecting
the ganglia. Besides
these processes there are
large, thin, longitudinal partitions
passing down from
the tergum (or dorsum),
called <i>phragmas</i>; they are
most developed in those
insects which fly best, <i>i.e.</i>
in Coleoptera (Figs. 97–101),
Lepidoptera, Diptera, and
Hymenoptera, none being
developed in the prothorax.
(The term <i>phragma</i> has also
been applied to a partition formed by the inflexed hinder edge
of this segment, and is present only in those insects in which
the prothorax is movable.—Century Dictionary.) All these ingrowths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>may be in general
termed <i>apodemes</i>. There
are similar structures in
Crustacea and also in Limulus;
but Sharp restricts this
term to minute projections
in beetles (Goliathus) situated
at the sides of the
thorax near the wings. (Insecta,
p. 103, Fig. 57.) The
internal processes arising
from the sternal region have
been called <i>endosternites</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The acetabula.</b>—These are
the cavities in which the
legs are inserted. They are
situated on each side of the
posterior part of the sternum,
in each of the thoracic
segments. They are, in general,
formed by an approximation
of the sternum and
epimerum, and sometimes,
also, of the episternum, as in
Dyticus (Fig. 97, <i>A</i>). This
consolidation of parts, says
Newport, gives an amazing
increase of strength to the
segments, and is one of the
circumstances which enables
the insect to exert an astonishing
degree of muscular
power.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The legs: their structure and functions</h4>

<p class='c016'>The mode of insertion of the legs to the thorax is seen in Figs. 90,
97, 101, and 103. They are articulated to the episternum, epimerum,
and sternum, taken together, and consist of five segments. The
basal segment or joint is the <i>coxa</i>, situated between the episternum
and trochanter. The coxa usually has a posterior subdivision or
projection, the <i>trochantine</i>; sometimes, as in Mantispa (Fig. 103), the
trochantine is obsolete. We had previously supposed that the trochantine
was a separate joint, but now doubt whether it represents
a distinct segment of the leg, and regard it as only a subdivision of
the coxa. It is attached to the epimerum, and is best developed in
Panorpidæ, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera. In the Thysanura the
trochantine is wanting, and in the cockroach it merely forms a subdivision
of the coxa, its use being to support the latter. The second
segment is the trochanter, a more or less short spherical joint on
which the leg proper turns; in the parasitic groups (Ichneumonidæ,
etc., Fig. 104) it is usually divided into two pieces, though there are
some exceptions. The trochanter is succeeded by the <i>femur</i>, <i>tibia</i>,
and <i>tarsus</i>, the latter consisting of from one to five segments, the
normal number being five. Tuffen West believed that the pulvillus
is the homologue of an additional tarsal joint, “a sixth tarsal joint.”
The last tarsal segment ends in a pair of freely movable claws
(ungues), which are modified setæ; between the claws is a cushion-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>pad or adhesive lobe, called the <i>empodium</i> or <i>pulvillus</i> (Fig. 105,
also variously called <i>arolium</i>, <i>palmula</i>, <i>plantula</i>, <i>onychium</i>, its appendage
being called <i>paronychium</i>
and also <i>pseudonychium</i>).
It is cleft or bilobate in many
flies, but in Sargus trilobate.
All these parts vary greatly in
shape and relative size in insects
of different groups, especially
Trichoptera, Lepidoptera,
Diptera, and Hymenoptera. In
certain flies (<i>e.g.</i> Leptogaster)
the empodium is wanting
(Kolbe). By some writers the
middle lobe is called the empodium
and the two others
pulvilli.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The fore legs are usually
directed forward to drag the body along, while the middle and
hind legs are directed outward and backward to push the body
onwards. While arachnids walk on the tip ends of their feet,
myriopods, Thysanura, and all larval insects walk on the ends of
the claws, but insects generally, especially the adults, are, so to
speak, plantigrade, since they walk on all the
tarsal joints. In the aquatic forms the middle
and hind tarsi are more or less flattened, oar-like,
and edged with setæ. In leaping insects, as the
locusts and grasshoppers, and certain chrysomelids,
the hind femora are greatly swollen owing to the
development of the muscles within. The tibia,
besides bearing large, lateral, external spines, occasionally
bears at the end one or more spines or
spurs called <i>calcaria</i>. The fore tibia also in ants,
etc., bear tactile hairs, and chordotonal organs, as
well as other isolated sense-organs (Janet), and, in
grasshoppers, ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Carabidæ the legs are provided with combs
for cleaning the antennæ (Fig. 107), and in the bees and ants these
cleansing organs are more specialized, the pectinated spine (<i>calcar</i>)
being opposed by a tarsal comb (Fig. 106, <i>d</i>; for the wax-pincers of
bees, see <i>g</i>). In general the insects use their more or less spiny
legs for cleansing the head, antennæ, palpi, wings, etc., and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>adaptations for that end are the bristles or spinules on the legs,
especially the tibiæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Osten Sacken states that among Diptera the aerial forms (Bombylidæ,
etc.) with their large eyes or holoptic heads, which carry with
them the power of hovering or poising, have weak legs, principally
fit for alighting. On the other hand, the pedestrian or walking
Diptera (Asilidæ, etc.) “use the legs not for alighting only, but for
running, and all kinds of other work, seizing their prey, carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>it, climbing, digging, etc.; their legs are provided not only with
spines and bristles, but with still other appendages, which may be
useful, or only ornamental, as secondary sexual characters.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Tenent hairs.</b>—Projecting from the lower surface
of the empodium are the numerous “tenent hairs,”
or holding hairs, which are modified glandular setæ
swollen at the end and which give out a minute
quantity of a clear adhesive fluid (Figs. 108, 109,
130, 134). In larval insects, and the adults of certain
beetles, Coccidæ, Aphidæ, and Collembola, which have
no empodium, there are one or more of these tenent
hairs present. They enable the insect to adhere to
smooth surfaces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Striking sexual secondary characters appear in the
fore legs of the male Hydrophilus, the insect, as
Tuffen West observes, walking on the end of the tibia
alone and dragging the tarsus after it. The last tarsal
joint is enlarged into the form of an irregular hollow
shield. The most completely suctorial feet of insects
are those of the anterior pair of Dyticus (Fig. 132).
The under side of the three basal joints is fused together and enlarged
into a single broad and nearly circular shield, which is convex above
and fringed with fine branching hairs, and covered beneath with
suckers, of which two are exceptionally large; by this apparatus of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>suckers the male is enabled to adhere to the back of its mate during
copulation. The line branching hairs around the edge prevent the
water from penetrating and
thus destroying the vacuum,
“while if the female struggle
out of the water, by retaining
the fluid for some time
around the sucker, they will
in like manner under these
altered conditions equally
tend to preserve the effectual
contact.” (Tuffen West.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the saw-flies (Uroceridæ
and Tenthredinidæ) and
other insects, there are small
membranous oval cushions
(<i>arolia</i>, Figs. 109 and 131)
beneath each or nearly each
tarsal joint.</p>

<p class='c013'>The triunguline larvæ of the Meloidæ are so called from apparently having
three ungues, but in reality there is only a single claw, with a claw-like bristle
on each side.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Why do insects have but six legs?</b>—Embryology shows that the ancestors
of insects were polypodous, and the question arises to what cause is due the
process of elimination of legs in the ancestors of existing insects, so that at
present there are no functional legs on the abdomen, these being invariably
restricted (except in caterpillars) to the thorax, and the number never being
more than six. It is evident that the number of six legs was fixed by heredity
in the Thysanura, before the appearance of winged insects. We had thought
that this restriction of legs to the thorax was in part due to the fact that this
is the centre of gravity, and also because abdominal legs are not necessary
in locomotion, since the fore legs are used in dragging the insect forwards, while
the two hinder pairs support and push the body on. Synchronously with this
elimination by disuse of the abdominal legs, the body became shortened, and
subdivided into three regions. On the other hand, as in caterpillars, with
their long bodies, the abdominal legs of the embryo persist; or if it be granted
that the prop-legs are secondary structures, then they were developed in larval
life to prop up and move the abdominal region.</p>

<p class='c013'>The constancy of the number of six legs is explained by Dahl as being in relation
to their function as climbing organs. One leg, he says, will almost always
be perpendicular to the plane when the animal is moving up a vertical surface;
and, on the other hand, we know that three is the smallest number with which
stable equilibrium is possible; an insect must therefore have twice this number,
and the great numerical superiority of the class may be associated with this
mechanical advantage. (This numerical superiority of insects, however, seems
to us to be rather due to the acquisition of wings, as we have already stated on
pages 2 and 120.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><b>Loss of limbs by disuse.</b>—Not only are one or both claws of a
single pair, or those of all the feet atrophied by disuse, but this process
of reduction may extend to the entire limb.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few insects one of the claws of each foot is atrophied, as in the feet of
the Pediculidæ, of many Mallophaga, all of the Coccidæ, in Bittacus, Hybusa
(Orthoptera), several beetles of the family Pselaphidæ, and a weevil (Brachybamus).
Hoplia, etc., bear but a single claw on the hind feet, while the allied
Gymnoloma has only a single claw on all the feet. Cybister has in general a
single immovable claw on the hind feet, but <i>Cybister scutellaris</i> has, according to
Sharp, on the same feet an outer small and movable claw. In the water bugs,
Belostoma, etc., the fore feet end in a single claw, while in others (Corisa) both
claws are wanting on the fore feet. Corisa also has no claws on the hind feet;
Notonecta has two claws on the anterior four feet, but none on the hind pair.
In Diplonychus, however, there are two small claws present. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the Scarabæidæ, the individuals of both sexes of the
fossorial genus Ateuchus (<i>A. sacer</i>) and eight other genera, among
them <i>Deltochilum gibbosum</i> of the United States, have no tarsi on
the anterior feet in either sex.
The American genera Phanæus
(Fig. 111), Gromphas, and Streblopus
have no tarsal joints in the
male, but they are present in the
female, though much reduced in
size, and also wanting, Kolbe
states, in many species of Phanæus.
The peculiar genus Stenosternus
not only lacks the anterior
feet, but also those of the second
and third pair of legs are each
reduced to a vestige in the shape
of a simple, spur-like, clawless
joint. The ungual joint is wanting
in the weevil Anoplus, and
becomes small and not easily seen
in four other genera.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ryder states that the evidence that the absence of fore tarsi in Ateuchus is
due to the inheritance of their loss by mutilation is uncertain. Dr. Horn suggests
that cases like Ateuchus and Deltochilum, etc., “might be used as an
evidence of the persistence of a character gradually acquired through repeated
mutilation, that is, a loss of the tarsus by the digging which these insects perform.”
On the other hand, the numerous species of Phanæus do quite as much
digging, and the anterior tarsi of the male only are wanting. “It is true,” he
adds, “that many females are seen which have lost their anterior tarsi by
digging; have, in fact, worn them off; but in recently developed specimens the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>front tarsi are always absent in the males and present in the females. If
repeated mutilation has resulted in the entire disappearance of the tarsi in one
fossorial insect, it is reasonable to infer that the same results should follow in
a related insect in both sexes, if at all, and not in the male only. It is evident
that some other cause than inherited mutilation must be sought for to explain
the loss of the tarsi in these insects.” (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., Philadelphia,
1889, pp. 529, 542.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The loss of tarsi may be due to disuse rather than to the inheritance
of mutilations. Judging by the enlarged fore tibiæ, which
seem admirably adapted for digging, it would appear
as if tarsi, even more or less reduced, would be in the
way, and thus would be useless to the beetles in digging.
Careful observations on the habits of these
beetles might throw light on this point. It may be
added that the fore tarsi in the more fossorial Carabidæ,
such as Clivina and Scarites, as well as those of
the larva of Cicada and those of the mole crickets (Fig.
112), are more or less reduced; there is a hypertrophy
of the tibiæ and their spines. The shape of the
tibia in these insects, which are flattened with
several broad triangular spines, bears a strong resemblance
to the nails or claws of the fossorial limbs of those mammals
which dig in hard soil, such as the armadillo, manis, aardvark,
and Echidna. The principle of
modification by disuse is well
illustrated in the following cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many butterflies the fore
legs are small and shortened, and
of little use, and held pressed
against the breast. In the Lycænidæ
the fore tarsi are without
claws; in Erycinidæ and Libytheidæ
the fore legs of the males
are shortened, but completely developed
in the females, while in
the Nymphalidæ the fore legs in
both sexes are shortened, consisting
in the males of one or two
joints, the claws being absent in
the females. Among moths loss of the fore tarsi is less frequent.
J. B. Smith<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> notices the lack of the fore tarsi in the male of a
deltoid, <i>Litognatha nubilifasciata</i> (Fig. 113), while the hind feet of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span><i>Hepialus hectus</i> are shortened. In an aphid (<i>Mastopoda pteridis</i>,
Esl.) all the tarsi are reduced to a single vestigial joint (Fig. 114).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Entirely legless adult insects are rare,
and the loss is clearly seen to be an adaptation
due to disuse; such are the females of
the Psychidæ, the females of several
genera of Coccidæ (Mytilaspis, etc.), and
the females of the Stylopidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apodous larval insects are common, and
the loss of legs is plainly seen to be a
secondary adaptive feature, since there are
annectant forms with one or two pairs of
thoracic legs. All dipterous and siphonapterous
larvæ, those of all the Hymenoptera
except the saw-flies, a few lepidopterous
larvæ, some coleopterous, as those of the
Rhyncophora, Buprestidæ, Eucnemidæ, and
other families, and many Cerambycidæ are
without any legs. In <i>Eupsalis minuta</i>,
belonging to the Brenthidæ, the thoracic
legs are minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legs of larvæ end in a single claw, upon the tips of which the
insect stands in walking.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Locomotion (walking, climbing, and swimming)</h4>

<p class='c016'><b>Mechanics of walking.</b>—To Graber we owe the best exposition of
the mechanics of walking in insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The first segment of the insect leg,” he says, “upon which the weight of
the body rests first of all, is the coxa. Its method of articulation is very different
from that of the other joints. The enarthrosis affords the most extensive
play, particularly in the Hymenoptera and Diptera.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the former the development of their social conditions is very closely connected
with the freest possible use of the legs, which serve as hands. In the
beetles, however, which are very compactly built, there exists a solid articulation
whereby the entire hip rests in a tent-like excavation of the thorax, and can
only be turned round a single axis, as may be seen in Fig. 115, where <i>c</i> represents
the imaginary revolving axis and <i>d</i> the coxa. In the case we are supposing,
therefore, only a backward and forward movement of the coxa is possible,
the extent of the play of which depends on the size of the coxal pan, as well
as certain groin or bar-like structures which limit further rotation. In the very
dissimilar arrangement which draws in the fore, middle, and hind legs toward
the body it is self-evident that their extent of action is also different. This
arrangement seems to be most yielding on the fore legs, where the hips, to confine
ourselves to the stag-beetles, can be turned backward and forward 60° from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the middle or normal position, and therefore describe on the whole a curve
of 120°. The angle of turning on the middle leg hardly exceeds a legitimate
limit, yet a forward as well as a backward rotation takes place. The former is
entirely wanting in the hind
hips; they can only be moved
backward.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 114.</span>—Leg of an Aphid, with the tarsus (<i>t</i>) much reduced: 1, 2, 3, legs of 1st, 2d, and 3d pairs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The number and strength
of the muscles on which the
rotation of the hips depends,
correspond with these varying
movements of the individual
legs. Thus, according to
Straus Durckheim, the fore
coxa of many beetles possesses
five separate muscles
and four forward and one
backward roll; the middle
coxa a like number of muscles
but only two forward rolls,
while the hind hips succeed
in accomplishing each of the
motions named with a single
muscle.</p>

<p class='c013'>One can best see how these
muscles undertake their work,
and above all how they are
situated, if he lays bare the
prothorax of the stag beetle (Fig. 116). Here may be seen first the thick
muscle which turns to the front the rotating axis in its cylindrical pan, and
thus helps to extend the leg, while two other tendons, which take the opposite
direction, are fitted for reflex movements.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order to simplify matters, we will imagine the second component part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of the normal insect leg, <i>i.e.</i> the trochanter (Figs. 116, 117, <i>r</i>), as grown together
with the third lever, <i>i.e.</i> the femur, as the movement of both parts mostly takes
place uniformly.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pulling of the small trochanter muscle
works against the weight of the body when
this is carried over on to the trochanter by
means of the coxa, as seen at the arrow <i>e</i> in
Fig. 115. It may be designated as the femoral
lever.</p>

<p class='c013'>The plane of direction in which the femur,
as seen by the rotation just mentioned, is
moved, exactly coincides in insects with that
of the tibia and the foot, while all can be
simultaneously raised or dropped, or, as the
case may be, stretched out or retracted.
Therein, therefore, lies an essential difference
from the fully developed extremities of vertebrates
among which, even on the lever arms
which are stationary at the end, an extensive
turning is possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>The muscles which move the tibia, and
indirectly the femur, also consist of an extensor
muscle which is situated in the upper
side of the femur (Fig. 116, <i>s</i>, Fig. 115, <i>f</i>),
and of a flexor (Fig. 116, <i>b</i>, Fig. 115, <i>g</i>),
which lies under the former.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stilt-like spines on the point (Figs.

<p class='c007'>Considering the respective positions
of the individual levers of the leg and
the nature of the materials of which they
are made, the legs of insects may be likened,
as Graber states, to elastic bows, which, when
pressed down together from above, their
own indwelling elasticity is able to raise
again and thus keep the body upright.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is very plainly shown in certain
stilt-legged bark-beetles, in which, as in a
rubber doll, as soon as the body is pressed
down on the ground, the organs of motion
extend again without the intervention of
muscles; indeed this experiment succeeds
even with dead, but not yet wholly stiff,
insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Graber then turns to the analysis of the
movements of insect legs when in motion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and the mode of walking of these insects in general. This subject
had been but slightly investigated until Graber made a series of
observations and experiments, of which we can give only the most
important results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The locomotion of insects is an extremely complicated subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us consider, Graber says, first, a running or carabid beetle, when walking
merely with the fore and hind legs. The former will be bent forward and
the latter backward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us begin with the left fore leg (Fig. 118, <i>L<sub>1</sub></i>). Let the same be extended
and fixed on the ground by means of its sharp claws and its pointed heel.
Now what happens when the tibial flexors draw together? As the foot, and
therefore the tibia also, have a firm position, then the contraction of the muscles
named must cause the femur to approach the tibia, whereby the whole body is
drawn along with it. This individual act of motion may be well studied in
grasshoppers when they are climbing on a twig by stretching out their long fore
leg directly forward, and then drawing up the body through the shortening of
the tibial flexors until the middle leg also reaches the branch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But while the fore legs advance the body by drawing the free lever to the
fixed leg-segment, the hind legs do this in exactly the opposite way. The hind
leg, namely, seeks to stretch out the tibia, and thus to increase the angle of the
knee (<i>R<sub>3</sub>)</i>, thereby giving a push on the ground, by means of which the body
is shoved forward a bit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Though it might be supposed that the feet would remain stationary during
the extension or retraction of the limbs, this never occurs in actual walking.
Not merely the upper, but also the lower, thigh is either drawn in or stretched
out, as the case may be. The latter then describes a straight line with its point
during this scraping or scratching motion (Fig. 115, <i>no</i>), which is obviously the
chord to that quadrant which would be drawn by the tibia or foot in a yielding
medium, as water, for instance. But even this motion results extremely rarely,
and never in actual walking. If we fix our eye anew upon the fore leg at the
very moment when it is again retracted, after the resultant ‘fixing,’ we shall
then observe that the hip also is simultaneously turned backward in a definite
angle. The tibia would describe the arc <i>nq</i> (Fig. 115) by means of the latter
alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This plane, in conjunction with the rectilinear ‘movement’ (<i>no</i>) obtained
by the retraction of the tibia, produces a path (<i>nr</i>), and this is what is actually
described by a painted foot upon a properly prepared surface, as a sheet of
paper;<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> supposing, however, that the body in the meantime is not moved forward
by other forces. In the last case, and this indeed always takes place in
running, the trunk is moved a bit forward, together with the leg which is just
describing its curve with a rapidity corresponding to the momentum obtained;
the result of this is that the curve of the foot from its beginning (<i>n</i>) to its end
(<i>a</i>) bends round close to itself, just as a man who, when on board a ship in
motion, walks across it diagonally, and yet on the whole moves forward, because
his line of march, uniting with that of the ship, results in a change of
position in space.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“The case is the same in the middle and hind legs, which must make a
double course also, yet in such a way that the straight line is drawn, not during
the retraction, but during the extension; during which, however, quite as in the
fore leg, the members mentioned (<i>R<sub>3</sub></i>) gradually approach the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the legs have reached the maximum of their retraction, or of their
extension, as the case may be, and therefore the end of their active course for
that time, then begins the opposite or backward movement; that is, the fore legs
are again extended, while their levers draw the remaining legs together again.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“At the same time, as we may see by the uniting leg, the limb is either a
little raised, that there may be no unnecessary friction, or it remains during the
passive step also, with its means of locomotion in slight contact with the ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The curve of two steps, as inscribed by the end of the tibia of the left fore
leg of a stag-beetle, affords an instructive summary of the conditions of which
we have been speaking (Fig. 121, <i>B</i>). We see two curves. The thick one (<i>ab</i>),
directed toward the axis of the body, corresponds to the effective act of a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>walking function, which brings the body a bit forward; the thinner, on the other
hand, or we might say the hair line (<i>bc</i>), which, however, is but rarely made
quite clearly, is produced by the ineffectual backward movement, by which the
insect again approaches its working posture (<i>c</i>). It is at first placed at some
distance from the body, in order that (like <i>c</i> also) it may draw near to the body
again; but in such a way, naturally, that it coincides with the starting-point of
the following active curve (<i>cd</i>). It is evident that even the passive curve is not
the imprint of the movement accomplished exclusively by the leg, for this latter,
while struggling to reach its resting-place, is really involuntarily carried forward
with the rest of the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The scroll-like lines drawn by the swimming beetle (Dyticus), with the
large, sharp points of its hind tibia, are also very instructive (Fig. 119, <i>A</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>“The diversions and modifications in the course of the active step, as furnished
by the moving factor of the remaining legs, are already clearly illustrated
by the curves shown by the joints of the hind tibia of a May-beetle (Fig. 120)
and a stag-beetle (Fig. 121, <i>c</i>). The actual faint line in this case does not run
from the front toward the back, as would correspond to the active leg-motion,
but either directly inward (Fig. 121, <i>cb</i>), or even somewhat to the front. In
the May-beetles, and even more in the running garden-beetle, the curves of the
hind legs present themselves as screw-like lines (Fig. 122, <i>l<sub>3</sub></i>), while the scrawling
of the remaining members (<i>l<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>l<sub>2</sub></i>) is much simpler.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Inasmuch as we now have a cursory knowledge of the movements made by
each individual leg for itself,—movements, however, which plainly occur very
differently according to the structure of these appendages,—the question now is
of the combined play, the total effect of all the legs taken together, and therefore
of the walk and measure of the united work of the foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In opposition to the caterpillars and many other crawling animals which
extend their legs in pairs and really swing them by the worm-like mode of contraction
of the dermo-muscular tube, the legs of fully grown insects are moved
in the contrary direction and in no sense in pairs, but alternately—or, more
strictly speaking, in a diagonal direction.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“For an examination of the gait of insects, we choose, for obvious reasons,
those which have very long legs and which at the same time are slow walkers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Insects may be called ‘double-three-footed,’ from the manner in which they
alternately place their legs. There are always three legs set in motion at the
same time, or nearly so, while in the meantime the remaining legs support the
body, after which they change places.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To be more exact, it is usually thus: At first (Fig. 118) the left fore leg
(<i>L<sub>1</sub></i>) steps out, then follows the right middle leg (<i>R<sub>2</sub></i>), and the left hind leg (<i>L<sub>3</sub></i>).
Then while the left fore leg
begins to retract and thus
make the backward movement,
the right fore leg is
extended, whereupon the
left middle leg and the right
hind leg are raised in the
same order as the first three
feet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Graber<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> painted the feet of beetles and let them run over paper, and goes on
to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us first pursue the tracks of the Blaps, for example (Fig. 123). Let the
insect begin its motion. The left fore leg stands at <i>a</i>, the right middle leg at β,
and the left hind leg at <i>c</i>. The corresponding number of the other set of three
feet at α, <i>b</i>, γ. At the first step the three feet first mentioned advance to <i>a′</i>β′<i>c′</i>,
the second set on the other hand to α′<i>b′</i>γ′. Thereby the tracks made by the
successive steps fall quite, or almost quite, on each other, as appear also in the
tracks of a burying beetle (Fig. 124).</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the fore legs are directed forward and the hind legs backward, while
the middle legs are placed obliquely, the reason of the more marked impressions
of the latter is evident.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The highest testimony to the precise exactitude and accuracy of the walking
mechanism of insects is furnished by the fact that in most insects, and particularly
in those most fleet of foot, which, whether they are running away
or chasing their prey, must be able to rely entirely upon their means of locomotion;—the
fact, we say, that whether they desire to move slowly or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>quickly, the distances of the steps, measured by the length as well as by the
cross-direction, hardly differ a hair’s breadth from one another, and this is also
the case when the tarsi are cut off and the insects are obliged to run on the
points of their heels (tibiæ).</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thence, inasmuch as the trunk of insects is carried by two legs and by one
on each side alternately, it may surely be concluded <i>a priori</i> that when walking
it is inclined now to the right and now to the left, and that the track, too, which
is left behind by a precise point of the leg, can in no wise be a straight line; and
in reality this is not the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A plainly marked regular curve, which approaches a sinuous line, as seen
in Fig. 125, is often obtained by painting many insects, for example Trichodes,
Meloë, etc., which, when running, either bring the end of their hind body near
to the ground or into contact with it.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The locomotive machine of insects may be called, to a certain extent, a
double set of three feet each, as most insects, and particularly those provided
with a broad trunk, are able to balance themselves with
one of these two sets of feet, and indeed when walking,
as well as when standing still, can move about even better
with one set of these feet than with four legs. In the latter
case, that is, if one cuts off a pair of legs from an insect, the trunk can balance
itself only with extreme difficulty, and there is therefore little prospect that
insects will ever become four-footed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But if one compels insects to run on three legs, he will thus make the interesting
discovery that to make up the deficiency they place the remaining feet
and bring them to the ground somewhat differently than when the second set
of feet is active. Figs. 124 and 126 may be compared for this purpose. The
former shows the footprints of a burying beetle running with all six legs, the
latter the track of the same insect, which, however, has at its disposal only the
right fore leg, the left middle leg, and the right hind leg. One may plainly see
here that the track of the hind leg on the right side (<i>r<sub>3</sub></i>) approaches the track of
the middle leg on the left side, and then further, that the <i>right fore leg</i> (<i>r<sub>1</sub></i>) <i>steps
out more to the right to make up for the deficiency of the middle leg</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“A similar adaptation of the position of the legs, which is entirely dependent
on the choice of the insect, may also be observed there, if one compels insects
which are not provided with corresponding adhesive lobes to run away over
crooked surfaces. Fig. 123 shows the footprints of a Blaps when running upon
a horizontal plane. Fig. 127, on the contrary, shows the tracks of the legs when
going diagonally over a gradually inclined surface. Here, also, the insect holds
on with his fore and middle legs (<i>r<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>) stretched upward, whereby also the
impressions on both sides come to lie farther apart than in the normal mode of
walking.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will not surprise the reader who is familiar with the gait of crabs, to hear
that many insects also understand the laudable art of going backward, wherein
the hind legs simply change places with the fore legs.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The jumping motion of insects may be best studied in grasshoppers. When
these insects are preparing for a jump, they stretch out the upper thigh horizontally,
clap the tibiæ together, and also retract the foot-segment. After a
slight pause for rest, during which they are getting ready for the jump, they
then jerk the tibiæ suddenly backward and against the ground with all their
strength by means of the extensor muscles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The correctness of Graber’s views has been confirmed by Marey by
instantaneous photographs (Figs. 128, 129).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Locomotion on smooth surfaces.</b>—How flies and other insects are
able to walk up, or run with the body inverted, on hard surfaces has
been lately discovered by Dewitz, Dahl, and others. All authors
are agreed that this power is due to the presence of the specialized
empodium of each tarsus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dewitz confirmed the opinion of Blackwell, that a glutinous liquid
is exuded from the apices of the tenent hairs which fringe the empodium.
By fastening insects feet uppermost on the under side of
a covering glass which projects from a glass slide, the hairs which
clothe the empodia of the foot of a fly (<i>Musca erythrocephala</i>) may
be seen to be tipped with drops of transparent liquid. On the leg
being drawn back from the glass, a transparent thread is drawn out,
and drops are found to be left on the glass. In cases where these
hairs are wanting, as in the Hemiptera, the adhesive fluid exudes
directly from pores in the foot. In the beetles (<i>Telephorus dispar</i>)
and other insects the tenent hairs on the foot end in sharp points,
below which are placed the openings of the canals. The glands,
Dewitz states, are chiefly flask-shaped and unicellular, situated in
the hypodermis of the chitinous coat; each gland opening into one
of the hairs (Fig. 108); they are each invested by a structureless
tunica propria, and contain granular protoplasm, a nucleus placed at
the inner side, and a vesicle, prolonged into a tube which, traversing
the neck of the gland, is attached to the root of the hair; the
vesicle receiving the secretion. Each gland is connected with a fine
nerve-twig, and secretion is probably voluntary. Among the tenent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>hairs of the empodium are others which must be supplied with a
nerve, forming tactile hairs, as they each proceed from a unicellular
ganglion (Fig. 108, <i>n″</i>). The secretion is forced out of the gland by
the contraction of the protoplasm, Dewitz having seen the secretion
driven out from the internal vesicle into its neck.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In the spherical last tarsal joint of Orthoptera (Fig. 109), which is without
these tenent hairs, nearly all the cells of the hypodermis are converted into unicellular
glands, each of which sends out a long, fine,
chitinous tubule, which is connected with its fellows by
very fine hairs and is continuous with the chitinous
coat of the foot and opens through it. The sole of the
foot is elastic and adapts itself to minute inequalities
of surfaces, while the anterior of each tarsal joint is
almost entirely occupied by an enlargement of the
trachea, which acts on the elastic sole like an air
chamber, rendering it tense and at the same time
pliant. Dewitz adds that the apparatus situated on the
front legs of the male of <i>Stenobothrus sibiricus</i> (Fig.
131) must have the function of causing the legs to
adhere closely to the female by the excretion of an
adhesive material. The hairs of the anterior tarsi of
male Carabi also appear to possess the power of adhesion.
In the house-fly the empodia seem to be only
called into action when the insect has to walk on
vertical smooth surfaces, as at other times they hang
loosely down.</p>

<p class='c013'>Burmeister observed the use of a glutinous secretion
for walking in dipterous larvæ, and Dewitz found that
the larva of a Musca used for this purpose a liquid
ejected from the mouth. The larvæ of another fly
(<i>Leucopis puncticornis</i>) perform their loop-like walk
by emitting a fluid from both mouth and anus. A
Cecidomyia larva is able to leap by fixing its anterior
end by means of an adhesive fluid. The larva of
the leaf-beetle, Galeruca, moves by drawing up its
hinder end, fixing it thus, and carrying the anterior
part of the body forward with its feet until fully
extended, when it breaks the glutinous adhesion. The
abdominal legs of some saw-fly larvæ have the same
power.</p>

with the phenomena not of actual
attachment by, as it were, gluing,
but of adhesion; the orifice of
the tubes is divided obliquely,
and the tubes are, at this point,
extremely delicate and flexible,
so as to adhere by their lower surface;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>in this adhesion they are aided by the secreted fluid.” In
the case of the Diptera he does not accept the theory by which the
movement of the fly along smooth surfaces is ascribed to an alternate
fixation and separation, but believes in a process of adhesion, aided
by a secretion, as in many Coleoptera. (In the Cerambycidæ there is
no secretion, and the tubules are merely sucking organs, like those
observed in the male Silphidæ.) “The attaching lobes, closely beset
with chitinous hairs, are
enabled, in consequence of
the pressure of the foot, to
completely lie along any
smooth surface; this expels
the air beneath the lobes,
which are then acted on by
the pressure of the outer
air.” (Journ. Roy. Micr.
Soc., 1884, p. 736.) Another
writer (Rombouts) thinks
this power is due to capillary
adhesion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The action of the pulvillus
and claws when at
rest or in use by the honey-bee
is well shown by Cheshire
(Fig. 135, <i>B</i>). In ascending
a rough surface,
“the points of the claws
catch (as at <i>B</i>) and the
pulvillus is saved from any
contact, but if the surface
be smooth, so that the
claws get no grip, they
slide back and are drawn
beneath the foot (as at <i>A</i>),
which change of position
applies the pulvillus, so that it immediately clings. It is the
character of the surface, then, and not the will of the bee, that
determines whether claw or pulvillus shall be used in sustaining it.
But another contrivance, equally beautiful, remains to be noticed.
The pulvillus is carried folded in the middle (as at <i>C</i>, Fig. 105), but
opens out when applied to a surface; for it has at its upper part
an elastic and curved rod (<i>cr</i>, Figs. 105 and 135), which straightens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>as the pulvillus is pressed down; <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, Fig. 135, making this
clear. The flattened-out pulvillus thus holds strongly while pulled,
by the weight of the bee, along the surface, to which it adheres, but
comes up at once if lifted and rolled off from its opposite sides, just
as we should pull a wet postage stamp from an envelope. The
bee, then, is held securely till it attempts to lift the leg, when
it is freed at once; and, by this exquisite yet simple plan, it can
fix and release each foot at least twenty times per second.” (Bees
and Bee-keeping, p. 127.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Ockler divides the normal two-clawed foot into three subtypes:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>(1) with an unpaired median empodium; (2) with two outer lateral
adhesive lobes; (3) with two adhesive lobes below the claws; the
latter is the chief type and forms either a climbing or a clasping
foot. The amount of movement possessed by the claws is limited,
and what there is, is effected by means of an elastic membrane and
the extensor plate (Fig. 110). The “extensor sole” which is
always present in insects with an unpaired median fixing or adhesive
organ (empodium) is to be regarded as a modification of the extensor
seta. The extensor plate is peculiar to an insect’s foot. Ockler
states that the so-called “pressure plate” of Dahl is only a movably
articulated, skeletal, supporting plate for the median fixing lobule.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Climbing.</b>—In certain respects the power of climbing supplies the
want of wings, and even exists often in house-flies among which
there is shown a many-sided motion that is quite unheard of in other
groups of insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best climbers are obviously those insects which live on trees
and bushes, as, for example, longicorn beetles and grasshoppers.
These may be accurately called the monkeys of the insect kind, even
if their movements take place less gracefully, and indeed rather
stiffly and woodenly. We already know what are the proper climbing
organs; that is, the sharp easily movable claws on the foot. With
the help of these claws certain insects, May-beetles for example,
can hang upon one another like a chain; indeed, bees and ants in
this manner bind themselves together into living garlands and
bridges. There are still added to the chitinous hooks flaps and
balls of a sticky nature, by help of which likewise the insects glue
themselves together. To facilitate the spanning of still thicker
twigs, the climbing foot of insects has a greater movability even
than when it only serves as a sole. (Graber.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The mode of swimming of insects.</b>—To study the swimming movements
of insects, let us examine a Dyticus. It will appear, as Graber
states, to be wonderfully adapted to its element.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“The body resembles a boat. There is nowhere a projecting point or a
sharp corner which would offer unnecessary resistance to motion; bulging out
in the middle and pointed at the end, it cuts through the resistance of the water
like a wedge. The movable parts, the oars, seem to be as well fitted for their
purpose as the burden to be moved by them. That the hind legs must bear the
brunt of this follows from their position exactly in the middle of the body, where
it is widest. In other insects also these legs are used for the same purpose as
soon as the insects are put in the water. But the swimming legs of water-beetles
are oars of quite peculiar construction. <i>They are not turned about in
the coxæ, as are other legs, but at the foot-joint.</i> The coxa, namely, has grown
entirely together with the thoracic partition. The muscles we have mentioned,
exceeding in strength all the soft parts taken together, take hold directly of
the large wing-shaped tendons of the upper thigh, and extend and retract the
leg in one of the planes lying close to the abdominal partition. The foot
forms the oar, however. It is very much lengthened and still more widened,
and can be turned and bent in by separate muscles in such a way that in the
passive movement, that is, the retraction, the narrow edge is turned to the fore,
and therefore to the medium to be dislodged; however, as soon as the active
push is to be performed and the leg is extended with greater force, it cuts down
through the water with its whole width. These effective oar-blades are still
considerably enlarged by the hairs arising on the side of the foot, which spread
out at the decisive moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Every one knows that the oar-blades of swimming beetles always go up
and down simultaneously and in regular time. On the other hand, as soon as
one puts a Dyticus on the dry land, <i>i.e.</i> on an unyielding medium, it uses its
hind legs entirely after the manner of other land insects; that is, they are drawn
in and extended again <i>alternately</i>, as takes place clearly enough from the footsteps
in Fig. 119, <i>A</i>. We learn from this that water insects have not yet, from
want of practice, forgotten the mode of walking of land insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The forcing up of the water as a propelling power is added to the repulsion
produced by the strong strokes of the oars. If the beetle stood up horizontally
in the water, he would be lifted up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the trunk, however, assumes an oblique position when the insect wishes
to swim, one can then imagine the driving up of the water as being divided
into two forces, one of which drives the body forward in a horizontal direction,
while the other, that is, the vertical component, is supplied by the moving of the
oars. The swimming insect is thus, as it were, a snake flying in the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The long streamer-like hind legs of many water-bugs, for example Notonecta,
approach more nearly our artificial oars. These legs are turned out from
the bottom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no doubt but that the legs of insects, as regards the many-sidedness
and exactitude of their locomotive actions, place the similar contrivances of
other animals far in the shade. We shall be forced to admire these ingenious
levers still more, however, when we take into consideration their energy and
strength. That the force with which the locomotive muscles of insects is drawn
together is enormous compared with that of vertebrates, we may learn if we try
to subdue the rhythmical movements of the thorax of a large butterfly by the
pressure of our finger or to open against the insect’s will the closed jumping leg
of a grasshopper, or the fossorial shovel of a mole-cricket.”</p>

  <h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The wings and their structure</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The insects differ from all other animals except birds in possessing
wings, and as we at the outset have claimed, it is evidently owing to
them that insects are numerically so superior to any other class of
animals, since their power of flight enables them to live in the air
out of reach of many of their enemies, the greatest destruction to
insect life occurring in the wingless larval and pupal stages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The presence of wings has exerted a profound influence on the
shape and structure of the body, and it is apparently due to their
existence that the body is so distinctly triregional, since this feature
is least marked in the synapterous insects. The wings are thin,
broad leaf-like folds of the integument, attached to the thorax and
moved by powerful muscles which occupy the greater part of the
thoracic cavity. The two pairs of wings are outgrowths of the middle
and hinder part of the thorax, the anterior pair being attached to the
mesothoracic and the hinder pair to the metathoracic segment. The
larger pair is developed from the middle segment of the thorax.
The differentiation of the tergites into scutum, scutellum, etc., is
the result of the appearance of wings, because these sclerites are
more or less reduced or effaced in wingless insects, such as apterous
Orthoptera and moths, ants, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The size of the hinder thoracic segments is closely related to that
of the wings they bear. In those Orthoptera which have hind wings
larger than those of the fore pair, the metathorax is larger than the
mesothorax. In such Neuroptera as have the hind wings nearly or
quite as large as the anterior pair, or in the Trichoptera and in the
Hepialidæ, the metathorax is nearly as large as the mesothorax,
while in Coleoptera the metathorax is as large and often much larger.
In the Ephemeridæ, Diptera, and Hymenoptera, which have either
only rudimentary (halteres) or small hind wings, the metathorax is
correspondingly reduced in size.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wings morphologically, as their development shows, are simple
sac-like outgrowths of the integument, <i>i.e.</i> of the free hinder edge of
the tergal plates, their place of origin being apparently above the
upper edge of the epimera or pleural sclerites. Calvert<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> however,
regards the upper lamina of the wing as tergal, and the lower, pleural.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wings in most insects are attached to the thorax by a membrane
containing several little plates of chitin called by Audouin
articulatory epidemes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The wings, then, are simple, very thin chitinous lamellate expansions
of the integument, which are supported and strengthened by
an internal framework of hollow chitinous tubes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The veins.</b>—The so-called “veins” or “nervures,” which are situated
between the upper and under layers of the wing are so disposed
as to give the greatest lightness and strength to the wings. Hagen
has shown that in the freshly formed wings these two layers can be
separated, when it can be seen that the veins pass through each layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>These veins are in reality quite complex, consisting of a minute
central trachea enclosed within a larger tube which at the instant the
insect emerges from the nymph, or pupa, as the case may be, is filled
with blood (Fig. 136). Since these tubes at first contain blood, which
has been observed to circulate through them, and since the heart can
be most easily injected through them, they may more properly be
called veins than nervures. The shape and venation of the wings
afford excellent ordinal as well as family and generic characters,
while they also enable the systematist to exactly locate the spots
and other markings of the wings. The spaces enclosed by the veins
and their cross-branches are called cells, and their shape often affords
valuable generic and specific characters.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The structure of a complete vein is described by Spuler. In a
cross-section of a noctuid moth (<i>Triphæna pronuba</i>, Fig. 136) the
chitinous walls are seen to consist of two layers, an outer (<span class='fss'>U</span>) and
inner (<i>c</i>), the latter of which takes a stain and lies next to the
hypodermis (<i>hy</i>). In the cavity of the vein is the trachea (<i>tr</i>),
which shows more or less distinctly the so-called spiral thread;
within the cavity are also Semper’s “rib” (<i>r</i>) and blood-corpuscles
(<i>bc</i>), which proves that the blood circulates in the veins of the completely
formed wing, though this does not apply to all Lepidoptera
with hard mature wings. We have been able to observe the same
structure in sections of the wing of Zygæna.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>A cross-section of a vein of <i>Pieris brassicæ</i> shows that the large
trachea is first formed, and that it extends along the track between
the protoplasmic threads connecting the two hypodermal layers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main tracheæ throw off on both sides a number of secondary
branches showing at their end a cell with an intracellular tracheal
structure; these accessory tracheæ afterwards branch out. The accessory
or transverse tracheæ often disappear, though in some moths they
remain permanently. Fig. 137 <i>tr<sub>2</sub></i> represents these secondary veins
in the edge of the fore wing of <i>Laverna vanella</i>, arising from a main
trachea (<i>tr</i>) passing through vein I (<i>v</i>), two of the twigs extending to
the centre, showing that the latter has no homology with a true vein.
Only rarely and in strongly developed thick folds are the transverse
tracheæ provided with a chitinous thickening, as for example in
<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>. Since from such accessory tracheæ the transverse
veins in lepidopterous wings are developed, we can recognize in
them the homologies of the net-veins in reticulated venations.
There is no sharply defined difference between reticulated and non-reticulated
venations; no genetic difference exists between the two
kinds of venation, since there occur true Blattidæ both with and
without a reticulated venation (Spuler).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fore wings of Odonata, Psocina, Mantispidæ, and most
Hymenoptera is an usually opaque colored area between the costal
edge and the median vein, called the <i>pterostigma</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In shape the wings are either triangular or linear oval, and at the
front edge the main veins are closer together than elsewhere, thus
strengthening the wings and affording the greatest resistance to the
air in making the downward stroke during flight. It is noticeable
that when the veins are in part aborted from partial disuse of the
wings, they disappear first from the hinder and middle edge, those
on the costal region persisting. This is seen in the wings of
Embiidæ (Oligotoma), Cynipidæ, Proctotrupidæ, Chalcids, ants, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The front edge of the wing is called the costal, its termination in
the outer angle of the wing is called the apex; the outer edge (termen)
is situated between the apex and the inner or anal angle, between
which and the base of the wing is the inner or internal edge.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in Orthoptera, dragon-flies, Termitidæ, and Neuroptera the
wings are not attached to each other, in many Lepidoptera they
are loosely connected by the loop and frenulum, or in Hymenoptera
by a series of strong hooks. These hooks are arranged,
says Newport, “in a slightly twisted or spiral direction along the
margin of the wing, so as to resemble a screw, and when the wings
are expanded attach themselves to a little fold on the posterior margin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of the anterior wing, along which they play very freely when
the wings are in motion, slipping to and fro like the rings on the rod
of a window curtain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the base of the hind wings of Trichoptera and in the lepidopterous
Micropteryx there is an angular fold (<i>jugum</i>) at the base
of each wing (Fig. 138); that of the anterior wings is retained in
Eriocephala and Hepialidæ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the wings of Orthoptera as well as other insects, the fore
wings, especially, are divided into three well-marked areas, the costal,
median, and internal; of these the median area is the largest,
and in grasshoppers and crickets is more or less modified to form the
musical apparatus, consisting of the drum-like resonant area, with
the file or bow.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The squamæ.</b>—In the calyptrate Muscidæ, a large scale-like membranous
broad orbicular whitish process is situated beneath the base
of the wing, above the halter; (Fig. 94, 10 <i>sq.</i>) it is either small or
wanting in the acalyptrate muscids. Kirby and Spence state that
when the insect is at rest the two divisions of this double lobe are
folded over each other, but are extended during flight. Their exact
use is unknown. Kolbe, following other German authors, considers
the term <i>squama</i> as applicable to the whole structure, restricting the
term <i>alula</i> to the other lobe-like division.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>More recently (1890 and 1897) Osten-Sacken recommends “<i>squamæ</i>; in the
plural, as a designation for both of these organs taken together; <i>squama</i>, in the
singular, would mean the posterior squama alone, and <i>antisquama</i> the anterior
squama alone;” the strip of membrane running in some cases between them,
or connecting the squama with the scutellum, should be called the <i>post-alar
membrane</i>. By a mistake Loew, and others following him, used the word
<i>tegula</i> for <i>squama</i>, but this term should be restricted to the sclerite of the mesothorax
previously so designated (Fig. 90, <i>A</i>, <i>t</i>). The squama or its two subdivisions
has also by various authors been termed alula, calypta, squamula, lobulus,
axillary lobe, aileron, cuilleron, schuppen, and scale. (Berlin Ent. Zeitschrift,
xli, 1896, pp. 285–288, 328, 338.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The halteres.</b>—In the Diptera the hind wings are modified to form
the <i>halteres</i> or balancers, which are present in all the species, even in
Nycteribia, but are absent in Braula.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meinert finds structures in the Lepidoptera which he considers as the homologues
of the halteres of Diptera. “In the Noctuidæ,” he remarks, “I find
arising from the fourth thoracic segment (segment médiaire), but covered by
hair, an organ like the halter of Diptera.” (Ent. Tidskrift., i, 1880, p. 168.)
He gives no details.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Stylopidæ, on the contrary, the fore wings are reduced to
little narrow pads, while the hind wings are of great size.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>thyridium</i> is a whitish spot marking a break in the cubital
vein of the fore wing of Trichoptera; these minute thyridia occur
in the fore wings of the saw-flies; there is also an intercostal thyridium
on the costal part of the wings of Dermaptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fore wings of Orthoptera are thicker than the hinder ones,
and serve to protect the hind-body when the wings are folded; they
are sometimes called <i>tegmina</i>. It is noteworthy, that, according to
Scudder, in all the paleozoic cockroaches the fore wings (tegmina)
were as distinctly veined as the hinder pair, “and could not in any
sense be called coriaceous.” (Pretertiary Insects of N. A., p. 39.)
Scudder also observes that in the paleozoic insects as a rule the fore
and hind wings were similar in shape and venation, “heterogeneity
making its appearance in mesozoic times.” In the heteropterous
Hemiptera, also, the basal half of the fore wings is thick and coriaceous
or parchment-like, and also protects the body when they are
folded; these wings are called <i>hemelytra</i>. In the Dermaptera the
small short fore wings are thickened and elytriform.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The elytra.</b>—This thickening of the fore wings is carried out to
its fullest extent in the fore wings of beetles, where they form the
sheaths, shards, or <i>elytra</i>, under which the hind wings are folded. The
indexed costal edge is called the <i>epipleurum</i>, being wide in the Tenebrionidæ.
During flight “the elytra are opened so as to form an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>angle with the body and admit of the free play of the wings”
(Kirby and Spence). In the running beetles (Carabidæ), also in the
weevils and in many Ptinidae, the hind wings are wanting, through
disuse, and often the elytra are firmly united, forming a single hard
shell or case. The firmness of the elytra is due both to the thickness
of the chitinous deposit and to the presence of minute chitinous
rods or pillars connecting the upper and lower chitinous surfaces.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Hoffbauer finds that in the elytra of beetles of different families
the venation characteristic of the hind wings is wanting, the main
tracheæ being irregular or arranged in closely parallel longitudinal
lines, and nerve-fibres pass along near them, sense-organs being also
present. The fat-bodies in the cavity of the elytra, which is lined
with a matrix layer, besides nerves, tracheæ, and blood, contain secretory
vesicles filled with uric-acid concretions such as occur in the
fat-body of Lampyris. There are also a great many glands varying
much in structure and position, such occurring also in the pronotum
(Fig. 139).</p>

<p class='c013'>Meinert considers the elytra of Coleoptera to be the homologues of the tegulæ
of Lepidoptera and of Hymenoptera. He also calls attention to the alula
observed in Dyticus, situated at the base of the elytra, but which is totally
covered by the latter. The alulæ of these beetles he regards as the homologues
of the anterior wings of Hymenoptera and Diptera. No details are given in
support of these views. (Ent. Tidskrift, i, 1880, p. 168.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Hoffbauer (1892) also has suggested that the elytra are not the homologues of
the fore wings of other insects, but of the tegulæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>Kolbe describes the alula of Dyticus as a delicate, membranous lobe at the
base of the elytra, but not visible when they are closed: its fringed edge in
Dyticus is bordered by a thickening forming a tube which contains a fluid.
The alula is united with the inner basal portion and articulation of the wing-cover,
forming a continuation of them. Dufour considered that the humming
noise made by these beetles is produced by the alulets.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hoffbauer finds no structural resemblances in the alulæ of Dyticus to the
elytra. He does not find “the least trace of veins.” They are more like appendages
of the elytra. Lacordaire considered that their function is to prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the disarticulation of the elytra, but Hoffbauer thinks that they serve as contrivances
to retain the air which the beetle carries down with it under the surface,
since he almost always found a bubble of air concealed under it; besides,
their folded and fringed edge seems especially fitted for taking in and retaining
air. Hoffbauer then describes the tegulæ of the hornet and finds them to be,
not as Cholodkowsky states, hard, solid, chitinous plates, but hollow. They are
inserted immediately over the base or insertion of the fore wings, being articulated
by a hinge-joint, the upper lamella extending into a cavity of the side of
the mesothorax, and connected by a hinge-like, articulating membrane with the
lower projection of the bag or cavity. The lower lamella becomes thinner
towards the place of insertion, is slightly folded, and merges without any articulation
into the thin, thoracic wall at a point situated over the insertion of the
fore wing. The tegulæ also differ from the wings in having no muscles to move
them, the actual movements being of a passive nature, and due to the upward
and downward strokes of the wings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Comstock adopts Meinert’s view that the elytra are not true fore wings, but
gives no reasons. (Manual, p. 495.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Sharp,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a> however, after examining Dyticus and Cybister, affirms that this
structure is only a part of the elytron, to which it is extensively attached, and
that it corresponds with the angle at the base of the wing seen in so many
insects that fold their front wings against the body. He does not think that
the alula affords any support to the view that the elytra of beetles correspond
with the tegulæ of Hymenoptera rather than with the fore wings.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the elytra are modified paraptera (tegulæ) is negatived by the fact that
the latter have no muscles, and that the elytra contain tracheæ whose irregular
arrangement may be part of the modified degenerate structure of the elytra.
Kolbe finds evidences of veins. The question may also be settled by an examination
of the structure of the pupal wings. A study of a series of sections
of both pairs of wings of the pupa of Doryphora and of a Clytus convinces us
that the elytra are the homologues of the fore wings of other insects.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>e.</i> Development and mode of origin of the wings</h4>

<p class='c016'><b>Embryonic development of the wings.</b>—The wings of insects are
essentially simple dorsal outgrowths of the integument, being evaginations
of the hypodermis. They begin to form in the embryo before
hatching, first appearing as folds, buds, or evaginations, of the hypodermis,
which lie in pouches, called peripodal cavities. They are
not visible externally until rather late in larval life, after the insect,
such as a grasshopper, has moulted twice or more times; while in
holometabolous insects they are not seen externally until the pupa
state is attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of their origin is in a less satisfactory state than desirable
from the fact that at the outset the development of the wings
of the most generalized insects, such as Orthoptera, Termes, etc.,
was not first examined, that of the most highly modified of any
insects, <i>i.e.</i> the Muscidæ, having actually been first studied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>In the course of his embryological studies on the Muscidæ (<i>Musca
comitoria</i> and <i>Sarcophaga carnaria</i>) Weismann (1864) in examining
the larvæ of these flies just before pupation, found that the wings,
as well as the legs and mouth-appendages, developed from microscopic
masses of indifferent cells, which he called “imaginal discs.”
From the six imaginal discs or buds in the lower part of the thorax
arise the legs, while from four dorsal discs, two in the meso- and two
in the metathoracic segment, arise the fore and hind wings (Fig. 141.)
These imaginal buds, as we prefer to call these germs, usually appear
at the close of embryonic life, being found in freshly hatched larvæ.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id052'>
<img src='images/i_145.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 140.</span>—Imaginal buds in Musca,—<i>A</i>, in Corethra,—<i>B</i>, in Melophagus,—<i>C</i>, in embryo of Melophagus; dorsal view of the head; <i>b</i>, bud; <i>p</i>, peripodal membrane; <i>c</i>, cord; <i>hy</i>, hypodermis; <i>cl</i>, cuticula; <i>st</i>, stomodæum; <i>v</i>, ventral cephalic, behind are the two dorsal cephalic buds.—After Pratt.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As first observed by Weismann, the buds are, like those of the
appendages, simply attached to tracheæ and sometimes to nerves,
in the former case appearing as minute folds or swellings of
the peritoneal membrane of certain of the tracheæ. In Volucella
the imaginal buds were, however, found by Künckel d’Herculais to
be in union with the hypodermis. Dewitz detected a delicate thread-like
stalk connecting the peripodal membrane with the hypodermis,
and Van Rees has since proved in Musca, and Pratt in Melophagus,
the connection of the imaginal buds with the hypodermis (Fig. 140).
These tracheal enlargements increase in size, and become differentiated
into a solid mass which corresponds to the upper part of the
mesothorax, while a tongue-shaped continuation becomes the rudiment
of the wing. During larval life the rudiments of the wings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>crumple, thus forming a cavity. While the larva is transforming
into the pupa, the sheath or peripodal membranes of the rudimentary
wings are drawn back, the blood presses in, and thus the wings are
everted out of the peripodal cavities.</p>

<p class='c013'>Due credit, however, should be given to Herold, as the pioneer in these studies,
who first described in his excellent work on the development of <i>Pieris brassicæ</i>
(1815) the wing-germs in the caterpillar after the third moult. This discovery
has been overlooked by recent writers, with the exception of Gonin, whose
statement of Herold’s views we have verified. Herold states that the germs of
the wings appear on the inside of the second and third thoracic segments, and
are recognized by their attachment to the “protoplasmic network” (<i>schleimnetz</i>),
which we take to be the hypodermis, the net-like appearance of this
structure being due to the cell-walls of the elements of the hypodermal membrane.
These germs are, says Herold, also distinguished from the flakes of the
fat-body by their regular symmetrical form. Fine tracheæ are attached to the
wing-germs, in the same way as to the flakes of the fat-body. It thus appears
that Herold in a vague way attributes the origin of these wing-germs, and also
the germs of the leg, to the hypodermis, since his schleimnetz is the membrane
which builds up the new skin. Herold also studied the later development of
the wings, and discovered the mode of origin of the veins, and in a vague way
traced the origin of the scales and hairs of the body, as well as that of the colors
of the butterfly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Herold also says that as the caterpillar grows larger, and also the wing-germs,
“the larval skin in the region under which they lie hidden is spotted and
swollen,” and he adds in a footnote: “This is the case with all smooth caterpillars
marked with bright colors. In dark and hairy caterpillars the swelling
of the skin through the growth of the underlying wing-germs is less distinct or
not visible at all” (pp. 29, 30).</p>

<p class='c013'>It should be added that Malpighi, Swammerdam, and also Réaumur had detected
the rudiments of the wings in the caterpillar just before pupation under
the old larval skin. Lyonet (1760) also describes and figures the four wing-germs
situated in the second and third thoracic segments, but was uncertain as
to their nature. Each of these masses, he says, is “situated in the fatty body
without being united to it, and is attached to the skin in a deep fold which it
makes there.” He could throw no certain light on their nature, but says: “their
number and situation leads to the supposition that they may be the rudiments
of the wings of the moth” (pp. 449, 450).</p>

<p class='c007'>During the transformation into the pupa the imaginal buds unite
and grow out or extend along their edges, while the enveloping membrane
disappears. The rudimentary wings are now like little sacs,
and soon show a fusion of the two wing-membranes or laminæ with
the veins, while the tracheæ disappear, the places occupied by the
tracheæ becoming the veins. “Very early, as soon as the scales are
indicated, begin in a very peculiar way the fusion of the wing-laminæ.
There occur openings in the hypodermis into which the
cells extend longitudinally and then laterally give way to each other.
Hence no complete opening is found, but the epithelium appears
by sections through a straight line sharply bordered along the wingcavity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>It is a continuous membrane formed of plasma which I will call
the ground membrane of the epithelium. Through this ground membrane
pass blood-corpuscles as well as blood-lymph.” (Schaeffer.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards (1866) Weismann studied the development of the
wings in <i>Corethra plumicornis</i>, which is a much more primitive and
generalized form than Musca, and in which the process of development
of the wings is much simpler, and, as since discovered, more as
in other holometabolous insects. He also examined those of Simulium
(Fig. 141).</p>

<p class='c013'>In Corethra, after the fourth and last larval moulting, there arises at first by
evagination and afterwards by invagination a cup-shaped depression on each
side in the upper part of the mesothoracic segment within which the rudiment
of the wings lies like a plug. The wings without other change simply increase
in size until, in the transformation into the pupa by the withdrawal of the
hypodermis, the wings project out and become filled with blood, the tracheæ
now being wholly wanting, and other tissues being sparingly present.</p>

Hymenoptera, by Dewitz for Hymenoptera (ants) and Trichoptera; also for the
Neuroptera by Pancritius. In the ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon formicarius</i>) Pancritius
found no rudiments of the wings in larvæ a year old, but they were detected in
the second year of larval life, and do not differ much histologically or in shape
from those of Lepidoptera. In the Coleoptera and Hymenoptera the imaginal
buds appear rather late in larval life, yet their structure is like that of Lepidoptera.
In Cimbex the rudiments of the wings are not found in the young
larva, but are seen in the semipupa, which stage lasts over six weeks.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The general relation of the rudiments (imaginal buds) of the wings
of a tineid moth to the rest of the body near the end of larval
life may be seen in Figs. 142, 143 (Tinea?), the sections not, however,
showing their connection with the hypodermis, which has been torn
away during the process of cutting. That the wing is but a fold of
the hypodermis is well seen in Fig. 144, of Datana, which represents
a much later stage of development than in Figs. 142 and 143, the
larva just entering on the semipupa stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In caterpillars of stage I, 3 to 4 mm. in length, Gonin found the
wing-germs as in Fig. 145, <i>A</i> being a thickening of the hypodermis,
with the embryonic cells, <i>i.e.</i> of Verson, on the convex border.
The two leaves, or sides of the wing, begin to differentiate in stage
II (<i>C</i>, <i>D</i>), and in stage III the envelope is formed (<i>E</i>), while the
tracheæ begin to proliferate, and the capillary tracheæ or tracheoles
at this time arise (Fig. 145, <i>tc</i>). The wall of the principal trachea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>appears to be resolved into filaments, and all the secondary branches
assume the appearance of bundles of twine. Landois regarded them
as the product of a transformation of the nuclei, but Gonin thinks
they arise from the entire cells, stating that from each cell arises
a ball (peloton) of small twisted tubes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As the large branches penetrate into the wing, the balls (pelotons)
of fine tracheal threads tend to unroll, and each of the new ramifications
of the secondary tracheal system is accompanied in its course
by a bundle of capillary tubes. This secondary system of wing-tracheæ,
then, arises from the mother trachea at the end of the third
stage, when we find already formed the chitinous tunic, which will
persist through the fourth stage up to pupation. It differs from the
tracheoles in not communicating with the air-passage; it possesses
no spiral membrane at the origin, and takes no part in respiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gonin thus sums up the nature of the two tracheal systems in the
rudimentary wing, which he calls the provisional and permanent
systems. “The first, appearing in the second stage of the larva, comprises
all the capillary tubes, and arising from numerous branches
passes off from the lateral trunk of the thorax before reaching the
wing; the second is formed a little later by the direct ramification
of the principal branch.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“These two systems are absolutely independent of each other
within the wing. Their existence is simultaneous but not conjoint.
One is functionally active after the third moult; the other waits the
final transformation before becoming active.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Evagination of the wing outside of the body.</b>—We have seen that
the alary germs arise as invaginations of the hypodermis; we will
now, with the aid of Gonin’s account, briefly describe, so far as is
known, the mode of evagination of the wings. During the fourth
and last stage of the caterpillar of Pieris, the wings grow very
rapidly, and undergo
important changes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Six or seven days
after the last larval
moult the chitinous
wall is formed, the
wing remaining transparent.
It grows
rapidly and its lower
edge extends near the
legs. It is now much
crumpled on the edge,
owing to its rapid
growth within the
limits of its own segment.
Partly from
being somewhat retracted,
and partly
owing to the irregularity
of its surface,
the wing gradually
separates from its
envelope, and the
cavity of invagination
(Fig. 145, <i>c</i>)
becomes more like a distinct or real space. The outer opening of the
alary sac enlarges quite plainly, though without reaching the level of
the edge of the wing.</p>

<p class='c007'>This condition of things does not still exactly explain how the
wing passes to the outside of the body. Gonin compares these conditions
to those exhibited by a series of sections of the larva, made
forty-eight hours later, on a caterpillar which had just spun its girdle
of silk. At this time the wings have become entirely external, but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>says Gonin, we do not see the why or the how. The partition of
the sac has disappeared, and with it the cavity and the leaf of the
envelope.</p>

<p class='c013'>It appears probable that the partition has been destroyed, because the space
between the two teguments is strewn with numerous bits, many of which adhere
to the chitinous integument, while others are scattered along the edges of the
wings, in their folds, or between the wings and the wall of the thorax.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another series of sections showed that the exit of the fore wings had been
accomplished, while the hinder pair was undergoing the process of eversion.
In this case the partition showed signs of degeneration: deformation of the
nuclei, indistinct cellular limits, pigmentation, granular leucocytes, and fatty
globules.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the destruction of the partition, what remains of the layer of the
envelope is destined to make a part of the thoracic wall and undergoes for this
purpose a superficial desquamation. The layer of flattened cells is removed and
replaced by a firmer epithelium like that covering the other regions. It is this
renewed hypodermis which conceals the wing within, serves to separate it from
the cavity of the body, and gives the illusion of a complete change in its situation.
Other changes occur, all forming a complete regeneration, but which does
not accord with the description of Van Rees for the Muscidæ. Finally, Gonin
concludes that the débris scattered about the wing comes from the two layers of
the partition of the sac, from the flattened hypodermis of the renewed envelope,
from the chitinous cuticle of the wing, and from the inner surface of the
chitinous integument.</p>

<p class='c013'>He thinks that the metamorphosis of Pieris is intermediate between the two
types of Corethra and of Musca, established by Weismann, as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Corethra.</b>—The wing is formed in a simple depression of the hypodermic
wall. No destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Pieris.</b>—The rudiment is concealed in a sac attached to the hypodermis by a
short pedicel. Destruction of the partition and its replacement by a part of the
thoracic wall by means of the imaginal epithelium.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Musca.</b>—The pedicel is represented by a cord of variable length, whose cavity
may be obliterated (Van Rees). The imaginal hypodermis is substituted for
the larval hypodermis, which has completely disappeared, either by desquamation
(Viallanes), or by histolytic resorption (Van Rees).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Extension of the wing; drawing out of the tracheoles.</b>—When it is
disengaged from the cavity, the wing greatly elongates and the
creases on its surface are smoothed out; the blood penetrates between
the two walls, and the cellular fibres, before relaxed and sinuous,
are now firmly extended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the two tracheal systems, the large branches are sinuous, and
they are rendered more distinct by the presence of a spiral membrane;
but the two tunics are not separated as in the other tracheæ
of the thorax; moreover, the mouth choked up with débris does not
yet communicate with that of the principal trunk. The bundles of
tracheoles on their part form straight lines, as if the folds of the
organ had had no influence on them. As they have remained bound
together, apart from the chitinous membrane of the tracheal trunk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>they become drawn out with this membrane, at the time of exuviation,
<i>i.e.</i> of pupation, and are drawn out of the neighboring spiracle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is a very curious phenomenon, which can be verified experimentally:
if we cut off the wing, while sparing the larval integument around the thoracic
spiracles, we preserve the two tracheal systems; the same operation performed
after complete removal of the larval skin does not give the secondary tracheal
system.” (Gonin.) Deceived by the appearance of the tracheoles while still
undeveloped, Landois and Pancritius, who have not mentioned the drawing out
of the capillaries of the larva, affirm that they are destroyed by resorption in the
chrysalis.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“The study of the tracheæ is closely connected with that of the veins
(nervures). It is well to guard against the error of Verson, who mistakes for
these last the large tracheal branches of the wing. This confusion is easily
explained; it proves that Verson had, with us, recognized that the secondary
system is, in the larva, exempt from all respiratory function. Landois thought
that the pupal period was the time of formation of the veins. It seems to me
probable that they are derived from the sheath of the peritracheal spaces.”

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A. G. Mayer has examined the late development of the wings in
<i>Pieris rapæ</i>. Fig. 149 represents a frontal section through the left
wing of a mature larva and shows the rudiment of the wing, lying
in its hypodermal pocket or peripodal cavity. How the trachea
passes into the rudimentary
wing, and eventually
becomes divided into the
branches, around which the
main veins afterwards form,
is seen in Figs. 144, 147, 159.</p>

<p class='c007'>The histological condition
of the wing at this
time is represented by Fig.
151, the spindle-like hypodermal
cells forming the
two walls being separated by the ground-membrane of Semper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While in the pupa state,” says Mayer, “the wing-membrane is
thrown into a very regular series of closely compressed folds, a single
scale being inserted upon the crest of each fold. When the butterfly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>issues from the chrysalis, these folds in the pupal wings flatten
out, and it is this flattening which causes the expansion of the
wings.... It is evident that the wings after emergence undergo
a great stretching and flattening. The mechanics of the operation
appears to be as follows. The hæmolymph, or blood, within the
wings is under considerable pressure, and this pressure would
naturally tend to enlarge the freshly emerged wing into a balloon-shaped
bag; but the hypodermal fibres (<i>h</i>) hold the upper and lower
walls of the wing-membrane closely together, and so, instead of
becoming a swollen bag, the wing becomes a thin flat one. And
thus it is that the little thick corrugated sac-like wings of the freshly
emerged insect become the large, thin, flat wings of the imago....
The area of the wing of the imago of <i>Danais plexippus</i> is 8.6 times
that of the pupa. Now, as the wing of the young pupa has about
60 times the area of the wing in the mature larva, it is evident
that in passing from the larval state to maturity the area of the
wings increases more than 500 times.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>f.</i> The primitive origin of the wings</h4>

<p class='c016'>Farther observations are needed to connect the mode of formation
of the wings in the holometabolous insects with the more primitive
mode of origin seen in the hemimetabolous orders, but the former
mode is evidently inherited from the latter. Pancritius remarks
that the development of the rudiments of the wing in a hypodermal
cavity is in the holometabolic insects to be regarded as a later
inherited character, the external conditions causing it being unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Fritz Müller was the first to investigate the mode of development
of the wings of the hemimetabolic insects, examining the young
nymphs of Termites. He regards the wings as evaginations of the
hypodermis, which externally appear as thoracic scale-like projections,
into which enter rather late in nymphal life tracheæ which
correspond to the veins which afterward arise.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 152.</span>—Rudimentary wing of young nymph of Blatta, with the five principal veins developed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The primitive mode of origin of the wings may, therefore, be best
understood by observing the early stages of those insects, such as
the Orthoptera and Hemiptera, which have an incomplete metamorphosis.
If the student will examine the nymphs of any locust in
their successive stages, he will see that the wings arise as simple
expansions downward and backward of the lateral edges of the meso-
and metanotum. In the second nymphal stage this change begins
to take place, but it does not become marked until the succeeding
stage, when the indications of veins begin to appear, and the lobe-like
expansion of the notum is plainly enough a rudimentary wing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Graber<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> thus describes the mode
of development of the wings in
the nymph of the cockroach:</p>

<p class='c013'>“If one is looking only at the exterior
of the process, he will perceive sooner or
later on the sides of the meso- and metathorax
pouch-like sacs, which increase
in extent with the dorsal integument and
at the same time are more and more
separated from the body. These wing-covers
either keep the same position as
in the flat-bodied Blattidæ, or in insects
with bodies more compressed the first
rudiments hang down over the sides of
the thorax. As soon as they have exceeded
a certain length, these wing-covers
are laid over on the back. However,
if we study the process of development of
the wings with a microscope, by means
of sections made obliquely through the
thorax, the process appears still more
simple. The chief force of all evolution
is and remains the power of growth in
a definite direction. In regard to the skin this growth is possible in insects
only in this way; namely, that the outer layer of cells is increased by the folds
which are forced into the superficial chitinous skin. These folds naturally grow
from one moult to another in proportion to the multiplication of the cells, and
are not smoothed out until after the moulting, when the outer resistance is overcome.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“As, however, the first wing-layers depend upon the wrinkling of the general
integument of the body through the increase in the upper layer, the further
growth of the wings depends in the later stages upon the wrinkling of the epidermis
of the wing-membrane even, which fact we also observe under the
microscope when the new wings drawn forth from the old covers appear at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>first to be quite creased together. These wing-like wrinkles in the skin are not
empty pouches, but contain tissues and organs within, which are connected
with the skin, as the fat of the body, the network of tracheæ, muscles, etc.
Alongside the tracheæ, running through the former wing-pouches and accompanied
by the nerves, there are canals through which the blood flows in and
out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After the last moult, however, when the supply of moisture is very much reduced
in the wing-pouches, which are contracted at the bottom, their two layers
become closely united, and afterward grow into one single, solid wing-membrane.</p>

<p class='c013'>“These thick-walled blood-tubes arising above and beneath the upper and
lower membrane of the wing are the veins of the wings; the development of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the creased wings in the pupa of butterflies is exactly like that of cockroaches
and bugs. The difference is only that the folds of integument furnishing the
wings with an ample store of material for their construction reach in a relatively
shorter time, that is the space of time between two moults, the same extent that
they would otherwise attain only in the course of several periods of growth in
the ametabolous insects.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Ignorant of Graber’s paper, we had arrived at the same result,
after an examination of the early nymph-stages of the cockroach, as
well as the locusts, Termites, and various Hemiptera. In all these
forms it is plainly to be seen that the wings are simply expansions,
either horizontal or partly vertical (where, as in locusts, etc., the
body is compressed, and the meso- and metanota are rounded downwards),
of the hinder and outer edge of the meso- and metanotum.
As will be seen by reference to the accompanying figures, the wings
are notal (tergal) outgrowths from the dorsal arch of the two hinder
segments of the thorax. At first, as seen in the young pupal cockroach
(Fig. 152) and locust (Fig. 153, also Figs. 154 and 156) the rudiments
of the wings are continuous with the notum. Late in nymphal
life a suture and a hinge-joint appear at the base of the wing, and
thus there is some movement of the wing upon the notum; finally,
the tracheæ are well developed in the wings, and numerous small
sclerites are differentiated at the base of the wing, to which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>special muscles of flight are attached, and thus the wings, after the
last nymphal moult, have the power of flapping, and of sustaining
the insect in the air; they thus become true organs of flight.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be observed, then, that the wings in all hemimetabolous
insects are outgrowths from the notum, and not from the flanks
or pleurum of the thorax. There is, then, no structure in any other
part of the body with which they are homologous.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The same may be said of the true
Neuroptera, Trichoptera (Fig. 157), the
Coleoptera, and the Diptera, Lepidoptera,
and Hymenoptera. As we have
observed in the house fly,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> the wings
are evidently outgrowths of the meso-
and metanotum; we have also observed
this to be most probably the case in
the Lepidoptera, from observations on
a Tortrix in different stages of metamorphosis.
It is also the case with
the Hymenoptera, as we have observed
in bees and wasps;<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> and in these
forms, and probably all Hymenoptera,
the wings are outgrowths of the scutal
region of the notum.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these facts before us we may
speculate as to the probable origin of
the wings of insects. The views held
by some are those of Gegenbaur, also
adopted by Lubbock, and originally by
myself.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> According to Gegenbaur:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The wings must be regarded as homologous
with the lamellar tracheal gills, for
they do not only agree with them in origin, but also in their connection with
the body, and in structure. In being limited to the second and third thoracic
segments they point to a reduction in the number of the tracheal gills. It is
quite clear that we must suppose that the wings did not arise as such, but were
developed from organs which had another function, such as the tracheal gills;
I mean to say that such a supposition is necessary, for we cannot imagine that
the wings functioned as such in the lower stages of their development, and
that they could have been developed by having such a function.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If we examine the tracheal gills of the smaller dragon-fly (Agrion),
or the May-flies, or Sialidæ, or Perlidæ, or Phryganeidæ, we see that
they are developed in a very arbitrary way, either at the end of the
abdomen, or on the sternum, or from the pleurum; moreover, in
structure they invariably have but a single trachea, from which
minute twigs branch out;<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> in the wings there are five or six main
tracheæ, which give rise to the veins. Thus, in themselves, irrespective
of their position, they are not the homologues of the gills.
The latter are only developed
in the aquatic representatives
of the Neuroptera and Pseudoneuroptera,
and are evidently
adaptive, secondary, temporary
organs, and are in no sense
ancestral, primitive structures
from which the wings were
developed. There is no good
reason to suppose that the
aquatic Odonata or Ephemerids
or Neuroptera were not descendants
of terrestrial forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>To these results we had
arrived by a review of the
above-mentioned facts, before
meeting with Fritz Müller’s
opinions, derived from a study
of the development of the
wings of Calotermes (Fig. 158).
Müller<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> states that “(1) The
wings of insects have not
originated from ‘tracheal gills.’ The wing-shaped continuations of
the youngest larvæ are in fact the only parts in which air tubes are
completely wanting, while tracheæ are richly developed in all other
parts of the body.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> (2) The wings of insects have arisen from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>lateral continuations of the dorsal plates of the body-segments with
which they are connected.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, speculating on the primary origin of wings, we need not suppose that
they originated in any aquatic form, but in some ancestral land insect related
to existing cockroaches and Termes. We may imagine that the tergites (or
notum) of the two hinder segments of the thorax grew out laterally in some
leaping and running insect; that the expansion became of use in aiding to support
the body in its longer leaps, somewhat as the lateral expansions of the
body aid the flying squirrel or certain lizards in supporting the body during
their leaps. By natural selection these structures would be transmitted in an
improved condition until they became flexible, <i>i.e.</i> attached by a rude hinge-joint
to the tergal plates of the meso- and metathorax. Then by continued use
and attempts at flight they would grow larger, until they would become permanent
organs, though still rudimentary, as in many existing Orthoptera, such as
certain Blattariæ and Pezotettix. By this time a fold or hinge having been
established, small chitinous pieces enclosed in membrane would appear, until
we should have a hinge flexible enough to allow the wing to be folded on the
back, and also to have a flapping motion. A stray tracheal twig would naturally
press or grow into the base of the new structure. After the trachea running
towards the base of the wing had begun to send off branches into the rudimentary
structure, the number and direction of the future veins would become
determined on simple mechanical principles. The rudimentary structures beating
the air would need to be strengthened on the front or costal edge. Here,
then, would be developed the larger number of main veins, two or three close
together, and parallel. These would be the costal, subcostal, and median veins.
They would throw out branches to strengthen the costal edge, while the branches
sent out to the outer and hinder edges of the wings might be less numerous and
farther apart. The net-veined wings of Orthoptera and Pseudoneuroptera, as
compared with the wings of Hymenoptera, show that the wings of net-veined
insects were largely used for respiration as well as for flight, while in beetles
and bees the leading function is flight, that of respiration being quite subordinate.
The blood would then supply the parts, and thus respiration or aëration
of the blood would be demanded. As soon as such expansions would be of
even slight use to the insect as breathing organs, the question as to their permanency
would be settled. Organs so useful both for flight and aëration of the
blood would be still further developed, until they would become permanent
structures, genuine wings. They would thus be readily transmitted, and being
of more use in adult life during the season of reproduction, they would be still
further developed, and thus those insects which could fly the best, <i>i.e.</i> which
had the strongest wings, would be most successful in the struggle for existence.
Thus also, not being so much needed in larval life before the reproductive
organs are developed, they would not be transmitted except in a very rudimentary
way, as perhaps masses of internal indifferent cells (imaginal discs),
to the larva, being the rather destined to develop late in larval and in pupal life.
Thus the development of the wings and of the generative organs would go hand
in hand, and become organs of adult life.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

which spread out
fan-like in the interior
of the wing.
(Fig. 159). These
ramifications, as
seen under the microscope,
are very
irregular; they
form here and
there knots and
anastomoses. They
end abruptly in
tufts at a little distance
from the
edge of the wing.
A raised semicircular
ridge (<i>b</i>) surrounds the base of the wing, and within this the
capillaries are formed, while on the other side they are covered by
a cellular layer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Landois, he says, noticed neither the pedicel of the insertion of the wing (<i>i</i>)
nor the ridge (<i>b</i>). Herold only states that the tracheæ pass like roots into the
wing. Landois believed that they formed an integral part of it. Dewitz and
Pancritius used sections to determine their situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 160 will illustrate Landois’ views as to the origin of the
tracheæ and veins. <i>A</i> represents the germ of a hind wing attached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>to a trachea; <i>c</i> the elongated cells, in which, as seen at <i>B</i>, <i>c</i>, a fine
tangled tracheal thread (<i>t</i>) appears, seen to be magnified at <i>C</i>. The
cell walls break down, and the
threads become those which pass
through the centre of the veins.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The wing-rods.</b>—Semper discovered
in transverse sections of the
wings, what he called <i>Flügelrippen</i>;
one such rib accompanying the
trachea in each vein. He did not
discover its origin, and his description
of it is said to be somewhat
erroneous. Schaeffer has recently
examined the structure, remarking:
“I have surely observed the connection of this cellular tube with
the tracheæ. It is found in the base of the wing where the lumen
of the tracheæ is much widened. I only describe
the fully formed rib (<i>rippe</i>). In a cross-section it
forms a usually cylindrical tube which is covered
by a very thin chitinous intima which bears delicate
twigs (Fig. 161). These twigs are analogous
to the thickened
ridge of the
tracheal intima.
I can see no
connection between
the branches of the different
twigs. Through the ribs
(<i>rippen</i>) extend a central cord
(<i>c</i>) which shows in longitudinal
section a clear longitudinal
streaking. Semper regarded it
as a nerve. But the connection
of the tube with the trachea contradicts
this view. I can only
regard the cord as a separation-product
of the cells of the walls.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Other histological elements.</b>—These

<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and in the wing-veins at a later period, blood-corpuscles which are
more or less gorged with nutritive material, and also the “balls
of granules” of Weismann, which are perhaps the “single fat-body
cells” detected by Semper. Schaeffer also states that into the
hypodermal fold of the rudiments of the wings pass peculiar formations
of the fat-body and tracheal system, and connected with the
fat-body are masses of small cells which by Schaeffer are regarded as
blood-building masses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fine nerves have also been detected within the veins, Moseley
stating that a nerve-fibre accompanies the trachea in all the larger
veins in the insects he has examined (Fig. 162), while it is present
in Melolontha, where the trachea is absent.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>g.</i> Mechanism of flight</h4>

<p class='c016'><b>Marey’s views on the flight of insects.</b>—As we owe more to
Marey than to any one else for what exact knowledge we have of
the theory of flight of insects, the following account is condensed
from his work entitled “Movement.” The exceedingly complicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>movements of the wings would lead us, he says, to suppose that
there exists in insects a very complex set of muscles of flight,
but in reality, he claims, there are only the two elevator and
depressor muscles of each wing.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> And Marey says that when we
examine more closely the mechanical conditions of the flight of
insects, we see that an upward and downward motion given by the
muscles is sufficient to produce all these successive acts, so well coordinated
with each other; the resistance of the air effecting all the
other movements. He also refers to the experiments of Giraud
which prove that the insect needs for flight a rigid main-rib and a
flexible membrane.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id065'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 163.</span>—The two upper lines are produced by the contacts of a drone’s wing on a smoked cylinder. In the middle are recorded the vibrations of a tuning-fork (250 vibrations per second) for comparison with the frequency of the wing movements. Below are seen the movements of the wing of a bee.—After Marey.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If we take off the wing of an insect, and holding it by the small
joint which connects it with the thorax, expose it to a current of air,
we see that the plane of the wing is inclined more and more as it is
subjected to a more powerful impulse of the wind. The anterior
nervure resists, but the membranous portion which is prolonged
behind bends on account of its greater pliancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wings of insects may be regarded simply as vibrating wires,
and hence the frequency of their movements can be calculated by
the note produced. Their movements can be recorded directly on a
revolving cylinder, previously blackened with smoke, the slightest
touch of the tip of the wing removing the black and exposing the
white paper beneath; Fig. 163 was obtained in this way. By this
method it was calculated that in the common fly the wings made 330
strokes per second, the bee 190, the Macroglossus 72, the dragon-fly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>28, and the butterfly (<i>Pieris rapæ</i>) 9. Thus the smaller the species,
the more rapid are the movements of the wings.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 164.</span>—Appearance of a wasp flying in the sun: the extremity of the wing is gilded.—After Marey.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The path or trajectory
made by the tip of the wing
is like a figure 8. Marey
obtained this by fastening
a spangle of gold-leaf to
the extremity of a wasp’s
wing. The insect was then
seized with a pair of forceps
and held in the sun
in front of a dark background,
the luminous trajectory
shaping itself in
the form of a lemniscate
(Fig. 164).</p>

<p class='c013'>To determine with accuracy the direction taken by the wing at different
stages of the trajectory, a small piece of capillary glass tubing was blackened in
the smoke of a candle, so that the slightest touch on the glass was sufficient to
remove the black coating and show the direction of movement in each limb of
the lemniscate. This experiment was arranged as shown in Fig. 165. Different
points on the path of movement were tested by the smoked rod, and from the
track along which the black had been removed the direction of movement was
deduced. This direction is represented in the figure by means of arrows.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Theory of insect flight.</b>—“The theory of insect flight,” says Marey,
“may be completely explained from the preceding experiments. The
wing, in its to-and-fro movement,
is bent in various
directions by the resistance
of the air. Its action is
always that of an inclined
plane striking against a
fluid and utilizing that part
of the resistance which is
favorable to its onward
progression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This mechanism is the
same as that of a waterman’s
scull, which as it moves backwards and forwards is obliquely
inclined in opposite directions, each time communicating an impulse
to the boat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mechanism in the case of the insect’s wing is far simpler,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>however, than in the process of sculling, since “the flexible membrane
which constitutes the anterior part of the wing presents a
rigid border, which enables the wing to incline itself at the most
favorable angle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The muscles only maintain the
to-and-fro movement, the resistance
of the air does the rest,
namely, effects those changes in
surface obliquity which determine
the formation of an 8–shaped trajectory
by the extremity of the
wing.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id068'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 166.</span>—Bee flying about in the chamber of the apparatus.—After Marey.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Lendenfeld has applied photography
to determine the position of the wings
of a dragon-fly, and Marey has carried
chronophotography farther to indicate
the normal trajectory of the wing, and
to show the position in flight. Fig.
166 shows a bee in various phases of
flight. “The insect sometimes assumes
almost a horizontal position, in which
case the lower part of its body is much
nearer the object-glass than is its head,
and yet both extremities are equally
well defined in the photograph. The
successive images are separated by an
interval of <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>20</span></span> of a second (a long time
when compared to the total time occupied
by a complete wing movement,
<i>i.e.</i> <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>190</span></span> of a second). And hence it is
useless to attempt to gain a knowledge
of the successive phases of movement
by examining the successive
photographs of a consecutive series representing
an insect in flight. Nevertheless
an examination of isolated
images affords information of extreme
interest with regard to the mechanism
of flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have seen that owing to the
resistance of the air the expanse of wing
is distorted in various directions by
atmospheric resistance. Now, as the
oscillations during flight are executed in
a horizontal plane, the obliquity of the
wing-surface ought to diminish the
apparent breadth of the wing. This appearance can be seen in Fig. 167. There
is here a comparison between two Tipulæ: the one in the act of flight, the
other perfectly motionless and resting against the glass window.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id016'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The motionless insect maintains its wings in a position of vertical extension; the plane is therefore at right angles to the axis of the object-glass. The
breadth of the wing can be seen in its entirety; the nervures can be counted,
and the rounding off of the extremities of the wings is perfectly obvious. On
the other hand, the flying insect moves its wings in a horizontal direction, and
owing to the resistance of the air the expanse of the wings is obliquely disposed,
and only the projection of its surface can be seen in the photograph. This is
why the extremity of the wings appears as if it were pointed, while the other
parts look much narrower than normal. The extent of the obliquity can be
measured from the apparent alteration in width, for the projection of this plane
with the vertical is the sine of the angle. From this it may be gathered that
the right wing (Fig. 168, third image) was inclined at an angle of about 50°
with the vertical, say 40° with the horizontal. This inclination necessarily
varies at different points of the trajectory and must augment with the rapidity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of movement; the obliquity reaching its maximum in those portions of the
wings which move with the greatest velocity, namely, towards the extremities.
The result is that the wing becomes twisted at certain periods of the movement.”
(See the fourth image in Fig. 168.) The position of the balancers
seems to vary according to that of the wings. (Marey’s Movement, pp. 253–257.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Graber’s views as to the mechanism
of the wings, flight, etc.</b>—Although
in reality insects possess
but four wings, nature, says
Graber, evidently endeavors to
make them dipteral. This end
is attained in a twofold manner.
In the butterflies, bees, and
cicadas, the four wings never act
independently of each other, as
two individual pairs, but they
are always joined to a single
flying plate by means of peculiar
hooks, rows of claws, grooved
clamps, and similar contrivances
proceeding from the modified
edges of the wings; indeed, this
connection is usually carried so
far that the hind wings are
entirely taken in tow by the
front, and consequently possess
a relatively weak mechanism of
motion. The other mode of wing
reduction consists in the fact that
one pair is thrown entirely out
of employment. We observe this
for instance in bugs, beetles,
grasshoppers, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the meantime, then, we may not
trust to appearances. As their development
indeed teaches us, the wings
as well as the additional members
must be regarded as actual evaginations
of the common sockets of the
body, and in order especially to refute
the prevalent opinion that these wing-membranes are void of sensation, it should
be remembered that Leydig has proved the existence, as well as one can be convinced
by experiment, of a nerve-end apparatus in certain basal or radical veins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of the wing-membrane, which is very extensive and complicated, and therefore
indicates the performance of an important function, perhaps of a kind of
balancing sense, and also that these same insect wings, with their delicate
membrane, are very easily affected by different outside agents, as, for instance,
warmth, currents of air, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Usually in their inactive or passive state the wings are held off
horizontally from the body during flight, and are laid upon the back
again when the insect alights; but an exception occurs in most
butterflies and Neuroptera, among which the wing-joint allows only
one movement round the oblique and long axis of the wings. From
this cause, too, the insects just mentioned can unfold their wings
suddenly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id070'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 169.</span>—Anterior part of a Cicada for demonstrating the mechanism of the articulation of the fore wing: <i>a</i>, articular head; <i>b</i>, articular pan, frog, or cotyla; <i>g</i>, elastic band; <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, system of elastic rods; <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>2</sub>, 1st and 2d abdominal segments. <i>HF</i>, hind wings.—After Graber.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The transition of the wings from the active to the resting condition
seems to be by way of a purely passive process, which, therefore,
usually gives no trouble to the insect. The wing being
extended by the tractive power of the muscles, flies back, when this
ceases, to its former or resting posture by means of its natural elasticity,
like a spiral spring disturbed from its balance. The structure
of this spring joint is very different, however.</p>

<p class='c013'>It usually consists (Fig. 169) of two parts. The wing can move itself up and
down in a vertical plane by means of the forward joint, and at the same time can
rotate somewhat round its long axis, because the chitinous part mentioned above
is ground off after the fashion of a mandrel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hinder joint, at a greater distance from the body, virtually consists of a
rounded piece (<i>a</i>) capitate towards the outside, and of a prettily hollowed socket
(<i>b</i>) formed by the union of the thick ribs of the hind wings, which slides round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the head joint when the wings snap back upon the back. The mechanism which
causes this turning is, however, of a somewhat complicated nature. The most
instrumental part of it is the powerful elastic band (<i>g</i>) which is stretched over
from the hinder edge of the mesothorax (<i>R<sub>2</sub></i>) towards that of the wings. This
membrane is extended by the expansion of the wings, and draws them towards
the body as soon as the contraction of the muscles relaxes. This closing band
of the wings is assisted by a leverage system consisting of three little chitinous
rods (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>), which at its joining presses inwards on the body on one side, and
on the hinder edge and head-joint of the wing on the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>We must, however, lay great stress on a few more kinds of wing support.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The wing-cases of beetles at their return from flight are joined together like
the shells of a mussel on the inside as well as to the wedge-shaped plate
(Fig. 170, <i>schi</i>) between
their bases. There is even
a kind of clasp at hand for
this purpose. The base of
the wing, that is, bears a
pair of tooth-like projections
(<i>za</i>), which fit into the corresponding
hollows of the
little plate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The commissure arising
from the joining of the inner
edges is characteristic. Usually
the wings on both sides
interlock by means of a
groove, as in stag-beetles,
but sometimes even, as in
Chlamys, after the manner
of two cog-wheels, so that
we have here also an imitation
of the two most prevalent
methods which the
cabinet-maker uses in joining
boards together.</p>

<p class='c013'>The act of folding the broad hind wings among beetles is not less significant
than the arrangement of the fore wing. If we forcibly spread out the former in
a beetle which has just been killed and then leave it to its own resources again,
we observe the following result: According to its peculiar mode of joining, the
costal vein on the fore edge approaches the mid or discoidal vein of the basal
half as well as the distal half of the wing, whence arises a longitudinal fold
which curves in underneath. Then the distal half snaps under like the blade of
a pocket knife and lies on the plane of the costal edge of the wing, while it also
draws after it the neighboring wing-area. The soft hinder-edge portion turns in
simultaneously when this wing-area remains fixed to the body while the costal
portion is moving towards the middle line of the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wing-membranes of almost all insects have, moreover, the capability of
folding themselves somewhat, and this power of extending or contracting the
wing-membrane at will is of great importance in flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, but how is the folded wing spread out again? The fact may be shown
more simply and easily than one might suppose, and may be most plainly
demonstrated even to a larger public by making an artificial wing exactly after
the pattern of the natural one, in which bits of whalebone may take the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of veins and a piece of india rubber the membrane spread out between them.
The reader will be patient while we just explain to him the act of unfolding of
the membranous wing of the beetle. The actual impulse for this unfolding is
due to the flexor muscles which pull on, and at the same time somewhat raise
the vein on the costal edge.
By this means the membranous
fold lying directly
behind the costal vein is
first spread out. But since
this fold is connected with
the longitudinal fold of the
distal end of the wing which
closes like a blade, the
wing-area last mentioned
which is attached to the
middle fold of the wing by
the elastic spring-like diagonal
vein becomes stretched
out. The hinder rayed portion
adjacent to the body
is, on the other hand,
simply drawn along when
the wing stands off from
the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order to properly
grasp the mechanism of
the insect wing we must
again examine its mode of
articulation to the body
somewhat more accurately.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>If we select the halteres
of a garden gnat (Tipula)
at the moment of extension,
we shall find them to
be formed almost exactly
after the pattern of our
oars, since the oblong oar-blade
passes into a longitudinal
handle. The pedicel
of the balancer is formed
by the thick longitudinal
primary veins of the wing-membrane.
This pedicel
(Fig. 171) is implanted in
the side of the thorax in
such a manner that the
wing may be compared to
the top of a ninepin. One
may think, and on the
whole it is actually the
fact, that the stiff pedicel of the wing is inserted in the thoracic wall, and that
a short portion of it (Fig. 172), projects into the cavity of the thorax. It is true
there is no actual hole to be found in the thoracic wall, as the intermediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>space between the base or pedicel of the wing and the aperture in the thorax is
lined with a thin yielding membrane, on which the wing is suspended as on an
axle-tree. According to this, therefore, the insect wing, as well as any other
appendage of arthropods,
acts as a lever with two
arms. The reader can then
conjecture what may be the
further mechanism of the
wing machine. We only
need now two muscles diametrically
opposed to each
other and seizing on the
power arm of the wing, one
of which pulls down the
short wing arm, thereby raising
the oar, while the other
pulls up the power arm.
And indeed the raising of
the wing follows in the manner
indicated, since a muscle
(<i>hi</i>) is attached to the end of the wing-handle (<i>a</i>) which projects freely into
the breast cavity by the contraction of which the power arm is drawn down.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, we have been entirely mistaken in reference to the
mechanism which lowers the wings. The muscle
concerned, that is <i>kd</i>, is not at all the antagonist
of the elevator muscle of the wing, since it is placed
close by this latter, but nearer to the thoracic wall.
But then, how does it come to be the counterpart of
its neighbor? In fact, the lever of the wing is situated
in the projecting piece alone. The extensor muscle
of the wing does not pull on the power arm, but on
the resistant arm on the other side of the fulcrum (<i>c</i>).
The illustration shows, however, how such a case is
possible. The membrane of the joint fastening the
wing-stalk to the thorax is turned up outwards below
the stalk like a pouch. The tendon of the flexor of
the wing passes through this pouch to its point of
attachment (<i>c</i>) lying on the other side of the fulcrum
(<i>d</i>). Thus it is very simply explained how two
muscles which act in the same direction can nevertheless
have an entirely contrary working power.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is in a way the bare physical scheme of the
flying machine by the help of which we shall more
easily become acquainted with its further details.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dragon-flies are unquestionably the most suitable
objects for the study of the muscles pulling directly
on the wing itself. If the lateral thoracic wall (Fig.
173) be removed or the thorax opened lengthwise
there appears a whole storehouse of muscular cords
which are spread out in an oblique direction between
the base of the wing and the side of the thoracic plate. There is first to be
ascertained, by the experiment of pulling the individual muscles in the line
with a pincers, which ones serve for the lifting and which for the lowering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of the wings. In dragon-flies the muscles are arranged in two rows and
in such a way that the flexors or depressors (<i>s</i>, 1 bis) cling directly to
the thoracic wall (compare also the muscle <i>dk</i> in Fig. 172 and <i>se</i> in Fig. 174),
while the raiser or extensor (<i>h</i> 1, to <i>h</i> 2, Fig. 172, <i>hi</i> and Fig. 174 <i>he</i>) lie farther
in. The form of the wing-muscles is sometimes cylindrical, sometimes like a
prism, or even ribbon-like. However, the contracted bundles of fibres do not
come directly upon the joint-process we have described, but pass over often
indeed at a very considerable distance from them, into peculiar chitinous tendons.
These have the form of a cap-like plate, often serrate on the edge, which
is prolonged into a thread, which should be considered as the direct continuation
of the base of the wings. The wings, therefore, sink down into the thoracic
cavity as if they were a row of cords ending in handles where the strain
of the muscles is applied.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As may be seen in Fig. 173, the contractile section of several of the muscles
of the wing (<i>s<sub>5</sub></i>) is extraordinarily reduced, while its thread-like tendon is proportionately
longer. This gradation being almost like that of the pipes of an
organ in the length of the wing-muscles, as may so easily be observed in the
large dragon-flies, plainly indicates that the strain of the individual muscles is
quite different in strength, since, as the phenomenon of flight demands it,
the different parts of the base of the wing become respectively relaxed in very
dissimilar measure.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have thus far discussed only the elevator and depressor muscles. Other
groups (<i>s<sup>1</sup>s<sup>3</sup></i>) are yet to be added, however, crossing under the first at acute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>angles, which when pulling the wing sidewise, bring about in union with the
other muscles a screw-like turning of the wings.</p>

<p class='c013'>While in dragon-flies all the muscles which are principally influential in moving
the wing are directly attached to it, and thus evidently assert their strength
most advantageously, the case is essentially different with all other insects.
Here, as has already been superficially mentioned above, the entire set of
muscles affecting the wing is analyzed into two parts of which the smaller
only is usually directly joined to the wings, while the movement is indirectly
influenced by the remainder (Graber).</p>

<p class='c013'>In the dragon-fly the two wings are “brought into correlative action by means
of a lever of unusual length existing amongst the chitinous pieces in the body
wall at the base of the wings (Fig. 175, <i>b</i>). The wing-muscles are large;
according to von Lendenfeld there are three elevator, five depressor, and one
abductor muscles to each wing. He describes the wing-movements as the
results of the correlative action of numerous muscles and ligaments, and of a
great number of chitinous pieces connected in a jointed manner” (Sharp).</p>

<p class='c013'>If again we take the longitudinal section of the thoracic cavity of gnats in
Fig. 171, we shall perceive a compactly closed system of muscular bars
intersecting each other almost at right angles and interlaced with a tangled mass
of tracheæ, some of which muscles extend (<i>lm</i>) longitudinally, that is from the
front to the back, while others (<i>b-r</i>) stretch out in a vertical direction, that
is between the plates of the abdomen and back.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order that we may more easily comprehend this important muscular
apparatus we will illustrate the thoracic cavity of insects by an elastic steel
ring (Fig. 172), to which we may affix artificial wings. If this ring be pressed
together from above downward, along the line <i>rs</i>, thus imitating the pulling
of the vertical or lateral thoracic muscles, then the wings on both sides spring
up. This is to be explained by the fact that through this manipulation a pressure
is exerted on the lifting power arm of the wings. If, on the other hand, the
ring be compressed on the sides (<i>ml</i>), which is the same thing as if the longitudinal
muscles contracted the thorax from before backward, and thus arched it
more, then the wings are lowered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Agrioninæ, according to Kolbe, can fly with the fore pair of wings or with the
hind pair almost as well as with both pairs together. Also the wings of these
insects can be cut off before the middle of their length without injuring their
power of flight. Butterflies, Catocalæ, and Bombycidæ fly after the removal of
the hind wings. Also the balancers of the Diptera must be useful in flying,
since their removal lessens the power of flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Chabrier regarded the under sides of the shell-like extended wing-covers of
the beetles as wind-catchers, which, seized by wind currents, carry the insect
through the air. We may also consider the wing-covers as regulators of the
centre of gravity of flight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The observations of insects made by Poujade (Ann. Soc. Ent., France, 1887,
p. 197) during flight teaches us, says Kolbe, that in respect to the movement
during flight of both pairs of wings, they may be divided into two categories:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. Into those where both pairs of wings (together), either united, and also
when separated from each other, perform flight. Such are the Libellulidæ,
Perlidæ, Sialidæ, Hemerobiidæ, Mymeleonidæ, Acridiidæ, Locustidæ, Blattidæ,
Termitidæ, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. Into those whose fore and hind wings act together like one wing, since
they are connected by hooks (hamuli), as in certain Hymenoptera, or are attached
in other ways. Here belong Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera,
Cicadidæ, Psocidæ, etc.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>The musculature of the mesothorax and metathorax is similar in those insects
both of whose pairs of wings are like each other, and act independently
during flight, viz. in the Libellulidæ. On the other hand, in the second category,
where the fore and hind wings act as a single pair and the fore wings are
mostly larger than the hinder (except in most of the Trichoptera), the musculature
of the mesothorax is more developed than that of the metathorax.</p>

<p class='c013'>To neither category belong the beetles, whose wing-covers are peculiar organs
of flight, and not for direct use, and the Diptera, which possess but a single pair
of wings. In the beetles the hind wings, in the Diptera the fore wings, serve
especially as organs of flight. It may be observed that the Diptera are the best
fliers, and that those insects which use both pairs of wings as a single pair fly
better than those insects whose two pairs of wings work independently of each
other. An exception are the swift-flying Libellulidæ, whose specially formed
muscles of flight explain their unusual capabilities for flying (Kolbe).</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In the abdomen the segments are more equally developed than
elsewhere, retaining the simple annular shape of embryonic life,
and from their generalized
nature their number can be
readily distinguished (Fig. 176).
The tergal and sternal pieces of
each segment are of nearly the
same size, the tergal often overlapping
the sternal (though in
the Coleoptera the sternites are
larger than the tergites), while there are no pleural pieces, the
lateral region being membranous when visible and bearing the
stigmata (Fig. 177, <i>L</i>). In the terminal segments beyond the genital
outlet, however, there
is a reduction in and
loss of segments, especially
in the adults of
the metabolous orders,
notably the Panorpidæ
(Fig. 177), Diptera, and
aculeate Hymenoptera;
in the Chrysididæ only
three or four being
usually visible, the
distal segments being
reduced and telescoped
inward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The typical number
of abdominal segments
(uromeres), <i>i.e.</i> that
occurring in each order
of insects, is ten; and
in certain families of
Orthoptera, eleven. In
the embryos, however,
of the most generalized
winged orders, Orthoptera (Fig. 199), Dermaptera, and Odonata,
eleven can be seen, while Heymons has recently detected twelve
in blattid and Forficula embryos, and he claims that in the nymphs
of certain Odonata there are twelve segments, the twelfth being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>represented by the anal or lateral plates. It thus appears that even
in the embryo condition of the more generalized winged insects, the
number of uromeres is slightly variable.</p>

<p class='c013'>We have designated the abdomen as the <i>urosome</i>; the abdominal segments
of insects and other Arthropods as <i>uromeres</i>, and the sternal sclerites as <i>urosternites</i>,
farther condensed into <i>urites</i>. (See Third Report U. S. Entomological
Commission, 1883, pp. 307, 324, 435, etc.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The reduction takes place at the end of the abdomen, and is
usually correlated with the presence or absence of the ovipositor.
In the more generalized insects, as the cockroaches, the tenth segment
is, in the female, completely
aborted, the ventral
plate being atrophied, while
the dorsal plate is fused during
embryonic life, as Cholodkowsky
has shown, with the
ninth tergite, thus forming
the suranal plate.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the advanced nymph of
Psylla the hinder segments of
the abdomen appear to be fused
together, the traces of segmentation
being obliterated, though the
segments are free in the first stage
and in the imago (Fig. 178). It
thus recalls the abdomen of
spiders, of Limulus, and the pygidium
of trilobites.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The median segment.</b>—There has been in the past much discussion
as to the nature of the first abdominal segment, which, in those
Hymenoptera exclusive of the phytophagous families, forms a part
of the thorax, so that the latter in reality consists of four segments,
what appearing to be the first abdominal segment being in reality
the second.</p>

<p class='c013'>Latreille and also Audouin considered it as the basal segment of the abdomen,
the former calling it the “segment médiaire,” while Newman termed it
the “propodeum.” This view was afterward held by Newport, Schiödte, Reinhard,
and by the writer, as well as Osten-Sacken, Brauer, and others. The
first author to attempt to prove this by a study of the transformations was Newport
in 1839 (article “Insecta”). He states that while the body of the larva
is in general composed of thirteen distinct segments, counting the head as the
first, “the second, third, fourth, and, as we shall hereafter see, in part also the
fifth, together form the thorax of the future imago” (p. 870). Although at first
inclined to Audouin’s opinion, he does not appear to fully accept it, yet farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>on (p. 921) he concludes that in the Hymenoptera the “fifth” segment (first abdominal)
is not in reality a part of the true thorax, “but is sometimes connected
more or less with that region, or with the abdomen, being intermediate between
the two. Hence we have ventured to designate it the <i>thoracico-abdominal</i> segment.”
Had he considered the higher Hymenoptera alone, he would undoubtedly
have adopted Latreille’s view, but he saw that in the saw-flies and Lepidoptera
the first abdominal segment is not entirely united with the thorax, being still
connected with the abdomen as well as the thorax. Reinhard in 1865 reaffirmed
Latreille’s view. In 1866 we stated from observations
on the larvæ made three years earlier, that
during the semipupa stage of Bombus the entire
first abdominal segment is “transferred from the
abdomen to the thorax with which it is intimately
united in the Hymenoptera,” and we added that
we deemed this to be “the most essential zoölogical
character separating the Hymenoptera from
all other insects.” (See Fig. 93, showing the
gradual transfer and fusion of this segment with
the thorax.) In the saw-flies the fusion is incomplete,
as also in the Lepidoptera, while in the
Diptera and all other orders the thorax consists
of but three segments. (See also pp. 90–92.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The cercopoda.</b>—We have applied this
name to the pair of anal cerci appended
to the tenth abdominal segment, and which
are generally regarded as true abdominal
legs. As is now well known, the embryos
of insects of different orders have numerous
temporary pairs of abdominal appendages
which arise in the same manner, have the
same embryonic structure, and are placed in
a position homologous with those of the
thorax. In the embryo of Œcanthus rudimentary
legs appear, as shown by Ayers,
on the first to tenth abdominal segment,
the last or tenth pair becoming the cercopoda;
and similar rudimentary appendages
have been detected in the embryos of
Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera
(Apidæ). Cholodkowsky has observed
eleven pairs of abdominal appendages in Phyllodromia.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are very long and multiarticulate in the Thysanura (Fig.
179). In the Dermaptera they are not jointed and are forcep-like.
It should also be observed that in the larva or Sisyra (Fig. 181)
there are seven pairs of 5–jointed abdominal appendages, though
these may be secondary structures or tracheal gills. In the Perlidæ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>and the Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ), they are very long, sometimes
over twice as long as the body, and composed of upward of
55 joints; they also occur in the Panorpidæ
(Fig. 177). In the dragon-flies
the cerci are large, but not articulated,
and serve as claspers or are leaf-like<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
(Fig. 180). In a few Coleoptera, as the
palm-weevil (<i>Rhynchophorus phœnicis</i>),
Cerambyx, Drilus, etc., the so-called ovipositor
ends in a hairy, 1–jointed, palpiform
cercus. Short 25–jointed cercopoda
are present
in Termitidæ,
and 2–jointed
ones
in Embiidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anal
cerci are
present in
the Orthoptera
and,
when multiarticulate,
function as abdominal antennæ. They
are longest in the Mantidæ (Fig. 182);
they also occur in the larva of the saw-fly,
Lyda (Fig. 183). Dr. A. Dohrn has
stated that the cerci of Gryllotalpa are
true sensory organs, and we have called
those of the cockroach
abdominal
antennæ, having
detected about
ninety sacs on
the upper side
of each joint of the stylets, which are
supposed to be olfactory in nature, and
which are larger and more numerous
than similar sacs or pits in the antennæ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>of the same insect.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> From his experiments upon decapitated cockroaches,

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Haase regarded these appendages, from
their late development and frequent reduction,
as old inherited appendages which are
approaching atrophy through disuse.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cholodkowsky states that Tridactylus, a
form allied to Gryllotalpa, bears on the tenth
abdominal segment two pairs of cerci (ventral
and dorsal), and that the ventral pair
may correspond to the atrophied appendages
of the tenth embryonic segment of Phyllodromia,
with which afterward the eleventh
segment becomes fused.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cercopods are not necessarily confined
to the eleventh or to the tenth segment,
for when there are only nine segments, with the vestige of a tenth, as in
Xiphidium, they arise from the ninth uromere, and in the more modern cockroaches,
as Panesthia, in which there are but seven entire segments, they are
appended to the last or eighth uromere.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>As to the homology and continuity of these cercopods with the
ventral outgrowths of the embryo, several embryologists, notably
Wheeler, are emphatic in regarding them as such. It thus appears
that either the embryonic appendages of the seventh or eighth,
ninth or tenth uromere may persist, and form the cercopoda of the
adult.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The ovipositor.</b>—The end of the oviduct is guarded by three pairs
of chitinous, unjointed styles closely fitted together, forming a
strong, powerful apparatus for boring into the ground or into leaves,
stems of plants, the bodies of insects, or even into solid wood, so
that the eggs may be deposited in a place of safety. In the ants,
wasps, and bees the ovipositor also functions as a sting, which is
further provided with a poison-sac.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morphologically, the ovipositor is composed of three pairs of unjointed
styles (<i>rhabdites</i> of Lacaze-Duthiers, <i>gonapophyses</i> of Huxley),
which are closely appressed to or sheathed within each other, the
eggs passing out from the end of the oviduct, which lies, as Dewitz
states, between the two styles of the lowest or innermost pair, and
under the cross-bars or at the base of the stylets mentioned; the
styles or blades spreading apart to allow of the passage of the egg.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The ovipositor is best developed in the Thysanura (Fig. 179, Campodea
excepted), in Orthoptera (Fig. 184), in the Odonata, Hemiptera,
certain Physapoda,
Rhaphiidæ, and in the
phytophagous Hymenoptera,
where it is curiously
modified to form
a rather complicated
saw for cutting slits in
wood or leaves (Fig.
185). It is wanting or
quite imperfect in
Coleoptera, Diptera,
and Lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morphologically, the ovipositor appears to be formed out of the
abdominal appendages of the seventh, eighth, and ninth segments of
the female, which, instead of disappearing in the orders first mentioned,
persist as permanent styles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wheeler asserts from his study of the embryonic development of
Xiphidium “there can be no doubt concerning the direct continuity
of the embryonic appendages with the gonapophyses.” He goes on
to say:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“One embryo, which had just completed katatrepis, still showed traces of all
the abdominal appendages. The pairs on the eighth, ninth, and tenth segments
were somewhat enlarged. In immediately succeeding stages the appendages of
the second to sixth segments disappear; the pair on the seventh disappear somewhat
later. Up to the time of hatching the gonapophyses could be continuously
traced, since in Xiphidium there is no flexure of the abdomen, as in other
forms, to obscure the ventral view of the terminal segments. From the time
of hatching Dewitz has traced the development of the ovipositor in another
locustid (<i>Locusta viridissima</i>), so that now we have the complete history of the
organ.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Heymons, however, is inclined to believe that they are simply
hypodermal outgrowths.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first to study the morphology of the ovipositor was Lacaze-Duthiers,
who referred their origin to the partially atrophied dorsal
or ventral sclerites of one of the last abdominal segments; a view
accepted by Gerstaecker<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> (Figs. 186, 187). The present writer (1866),
however, showed that the sting of Bombus was not formed of the
reduced pieces of the segments themselves, but arose from special
outgrowths on the ventral
side of the eighth and ninth
abdominal segments. These
appendages he did not at first
regard as the homologues of
the limbs, until in 1871, after
studying the origin of the
spring of the Podurans (Isotoma),
he found that it was a
true jointed appendage and
therefore a homologue of a
pair of the styles forming the ovipositor of the winged insects,
and that the three pairs of styles of the latter were homologues
of the thoracic legs and cephalic appendages. The view was
stated in the Guide to the Study of Insects. (See also Amer. Nat.,
March, 1871, p. 6.) Kraepelin also affirms that the styles of the
ovipositor are segmental appendages and homologues of the antennæ,
wings (<i>sic</i>), and legs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>An objection to this view is the fact that the posterior pairs of
styles appear to arise both from one and the same segment,—the
ninth. Dewitz questions whether the four appendages of the ninth
segment represent two pairs of limbs, or one pair split into two
branches, and prefers the latter view, but leaves it as a point to
be settled by future investigations. As will be seen below, both
Kraepelin and Bugnion observed a pair of rudiments to each of the
three penultimate segments, those of the middle pair splitting in two.
Wheeler maintains, erroneously we think, that the inner of the two
pairs on the ninth segment represents the
tenth pair of abdominal appendages; but in
reality this latter pair become the cercopods.
That there are probably originally in insects
of all the orders provided with an ovipositor
three distinct pairs of appendages, one to
each segment, is proved, or at least strongly
suggested, by Ganin’s researches on the
three pairs of abdominal imaginal discs of
the third larva of Platygaster and Polynema
(Fig. 188), which are transformed into the
ovipositor. He remarks that these imaginal
discs have the same origin and pass through
the same changes as those in front, <i>i.e.</i>
those destined to form the thoracic legs.
Dewitz has shown that the germs of the
ovipositor of the honey-bee arise as buds
on the two segments before the last (Fig.
189).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Kraepelin also detected in the larva of
the honey-bee a pair of what he regarded
as genuine imaginal buds on abdominal segments
eight, nine, and ten; the buds on the tenth segment are divided
each in two; of these four appendages the two median ones form the
barbed sting (<i>gorgeret</i> or <i>stachelrinne</i>), and the two lateral stylets,
the valves (<i>stachelscheiden</i>). The two buds of the ninth segment
give rise to the vagina and to the oviducts, and these unite secondarily
with the posterior end of the ovaries. The genital appendages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of the male correspond to those of the female, and arise from four
imaginal buds situated on the under side of the tenth abdominal
segment.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the ants, according to Dewitz, the genital armature is derived
from imaginal buds situated on the under side of the seventh, eighth,
and ninth abdominal segments. Bugnion has observed the formation
of six imaginal buds of the genital armature in the larva of a
chalcid (Encyrtus, Figs. 41, 42, 191, <i>q<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>q<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>q<sup>3</sup></i>), the transformation of the
central part of these
structures into small
digitiform pads, then
the division of the two
intermediate buds into
four (?) (Fig. 191, <i>B</i>, <i>q<sup>2</sup></i>),
but was unable to trace
their farther development.</p>

<p class='c013'>The subject still needs
farther investigation, since
certain observers, as Haase,
and, more recently, Heymons,
do not believe that
they are homologues of the
legs, but integumental structures,
though of somewhat
higher value than the style
of the base of the legs of
Scolopendrella and Thysanura;
but it is to be observed
that as yet we know
but little of the embryological
history of these styles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those authors who have
examined the elements of
the ovipositor, and regard
them as homologues (<i>homodynamous</i>) of the limbs, are Weismann (1866),
Ganin (1869), Packard (1871), Ouljanin (1872), Kraepelin, Kowalevsky (1873),
Dewitz (1875), Huxley (1877), Cholodkowsky, Bugnion (1891), and Wheeler
(1892).</p>

<p class='c007'>As shown, then, by our observations and those of Dewitz (Figs. 189
and 192), the rudiments of the ovipositor consist of three pairs of
tubercles, arising, as Kraepelin and also Bugnion (Fig. 191) have
shown, from three pairs of imaginal discs, situated respectively on
the seventh, eighth, and ninth uromeres, or at least on the three
penultimate segments of the abdomen. With the growth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>semipupa, the end of the abdomen decreases in size, and is gradually
incurved toward the base (Fig. 193), and the three pairs of appendages
approach each other so closely that the two outer ones completely
ensheath the inner pair, until a complete extensible tube is
formed, which, by the changes in form of the muscles within, is
gradually withdrawn entirely within the body.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>An excellent account of the honey-bee’s sting is given by Cheshire (Figs. 194,
195). The outermost of the three pairs of stylets forming the apparatus is the
two thick, hairy “palpi”
or feelers (<i>P</i>), these being
freer from the sting proper
than in the ovipositor of
Orthoptera. The sting
itself is composed of the
two inner pairs of stylets;
one of these pairs is united
to form the sheath (<i>sh</i>),
while the other pair form
the two barbed darts. The
sheath has three uses: first,
to open the wound; second,
to act as an intermediate
conduit for the poison; and
third, to hold in accurate
position the long barbed
darts. The sheath does
not enclose the darts as a
scabbard, but is cleft down
the side presented in Fig.
194, which is below when
the sting points backward.
But, says Cheshire, as the
darts move up and down,
they would immediately
slip from their position,
unless prevented by a
mechanical device, exhibited
by <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, giving
in cross-section sheath and
darts near the end, and at
the middle of the former. “The darts (<i>d</i>) are each grooved through their entire
length, while upon the sheath (<i>sh</i>) are fixed two guide rails, each like a prolonged
dovetail, which, fitted into the groove, permits of no other movement than that
directly up and down.” The darts are terminated by ten barbs of ugly form
(<i>D</i>, Fig. 194), and much larger than those of the sheath, and as soon as the latter
has established a hold, first one dart and then the other is driven forward by
successive blows. These in turn are followed by the sheath, when the darts
again more deeply plunge, until the murderous little tool is buried to the hilt.
But these movements are the result of a muscular apparatus yet to be examined,
and which has been dissected away to bring the rigid pieces into view. The
dovetail guides of the sheath are continued far above its bulbous portion, as we
see by <i>E</i>, Fig. 195; and along with these the darts are also prolonged upward,
still held to the guides by the grooved arrangement before explained; but both
guides and darts, in the upper part of their length, curve from each other somewhat
like the arms of a <span class='mono'>Y</span>, to the points <i>c</i>, <i>c′</i> (<i>A</i>, Fig. 194), where the darts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>make attachment to two levers (<i>i</i>, <i>i′</i>). The levers (<i>k</i>, <i>l</i> and <i>k′</i>, <i>l′</i>) are provided
with broad muscles, which terminate by attachment to the lower segments of
the abdomen. These, by contraction, revolve the levers aforesaid round the
points <i>f</i>, <i>f′</i>, so that, without relative movement of rod and groove, the points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span><i>c</i>, <i>c′</i> approach each other. The arms of the <span class='mono'>Y</span> straighten and shorten, so that
the sheath and darts are driven from their hiding-place together and the thrust
is made by which the sheath produces its incision and fixture. The sides being
symmetrical, we may, for simplicity’s sake, concentrate our attention on one, say
the left in the figure. A muscular contraction of a broad strap joining <i>k</i> and <i>d</i>
(the dart protractor) now revolves <i>k</i> on <i>l</i>, so that <i>a</i> is raised, by which clearly <i>c</i>
is made to approach <i>d</i>; <i>i.e.</i> the dart is sent forward, so that the barbs extend
beyond the sheath and deepen the puncture. The other dart, and then the
sheath, follow, in a sequence already explained, and which <i>G</i>, Fig. 195, is intended
to make intelligible, <i>a</i> representing the entrance of the sheath, <i>b</i> the
advance of the barbs, and <i>c</i> the sheath in its second position. The barb retractor
muscle is attached to the outer side of <i>i</i>, and by it <i>a</i> is depressed and the
barbs lifted. These movements, following one another with remarkable rapidity,
are entirely reflex, and may be continued long after the sting has been torn, as
is usual, from the insect. By taking a piece of wash-leather, placing it over the
end of the finger, and applying it to a bee held by the wings, we may get the
fullest opportunity of observing the sting movements, which the microscope will
show to be kept up by continued impulses from the fifth abdominal ganglion and
its multitudinous nerves (<i>n</i>, Fig. 194, <i>A</i>), which penetrate every part of the sting
mechanism, and may be traced even into the darts. These facts, together with
the explanation at page 49, will show why an abdomen separated many hours
may be able to sting severely, as I have more than once experienced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The male genital armature in the bees is originally composed of
three pairs of tubercles, homologous with those of the female, all
originally arising from three
abdominal segments, two afterward
being anterior, and the
third pair nearer the base of the
abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ovipositor of the dragon-flies
(Odonata) is essentially like
that of the Orthoptera and
Hymenoptera. Thus in Æschna
(Fig. 196), Agrion (Fig. 196, <i>C</i>),
and also in Cicada it consists
of a pair of closely appressed
ensiform processes which grow
out from under the posterior
edge of the eighth uromere and
are embraced between two pairs of thin lamelliform pieces of similar
form and structure.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The styles and genital claspers</b> (<i>Rhabdopoda</i>).—Other appendages
of the end of the abdomen of pterygote insects, and generally, if not
always, arising from the ninth segment, are the clasping organs,
or <i>rhabdopoda</i> as we may call them, of Ephemeridæ (Fig. 197),
Neuroptera (Corydalus [Fig. 198], Myrmeleon, Rhaphidia), Trichoptera,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Lepidoptera, Diptera, and certain phytophagous Hymenoptera.
They do not appear to occur in insects which are provided with an
ovipositor. In Thysanura the
styles are present on segments
1–9 (Fig. 179). Those of the
male Ephemeridæ, of which
there are two pairs arising from
the ninth segment, are remarkable,
since they are jointed, and
they serve to represent or may
be the homologues of two of the
pairs of stylets composing the
ovipositor of insects of other
orders. The lower pair (Fig.
197, <i>rh</i>) are either 2–, 3–, or
4–jointed (in Oniscigaster 5–jointed),
while those of the
upper pair are 2–jointed (<i>rh′</i>).
These rhabdopods in the ephemerids
are evidently very primitive
structures, since they
approach nearest in shape and
in being jointed to the abdominal
legs of Scolopendrella and
the Myriopoda. The styles of
the Orthoptera are survivals
of the embryonic appendages of
the ninth segment (Wheeler,
etc.). In Mantis they are seen
to have the same relations as the cerci,
as shown by Heymons (Fig. 200).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Phasmidæ, in Anabrus, and in
the Odonata the cercopods, which are not
jointed, are converted into claspers, and
in the Odonata the claspers are spiny
within, so as to give a firmer hold. The
suranal plate is apparently so modified as
to aid in grasping the female. In nearly
all the Trichoptera there are, besides the
suranal plate, which is sometimes forked
(Nosopus), a pair of superior and of
inferior claspers, and in certain genera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>(Ascalaphomerus, Macronema, Rhyacophila, Hydropsyche, Amphipsyche,
Smicridea, and Ganonema) the lower pair are 2–jointed like
those of Ephemeridæ. The number of abdominal segments in the
adult Trichoptera is nine, and McLachlan states that the genital
armature consists of three pairs of
appendages, <i>i.e.</i> a superior, inferior,
and intermediate pair, besides the
suranal plate (vestige of a tenth segment)
and the penis. Judging by his
figures, these three pairs of appendages
arise from the last or ninth uromere,
and the upper pair seem to be
the homologue of the cercopoda of
ephemerids. It needs still to be
ascertained whether the intermediate
pair is a separate set, or merely subdivisions
of the upper or lower, and
whether one of the latter may not arise from the penultimate segment,
because we should not expect that the last segment should
bear more than one pair of appendages, as we find to be the case
in arthropods in general, and in the Neuroptera, from which the
Trichoptera may have originated.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In most larvæ of the Trichoptera, especially the Rhyacophilidæ
and Hydropsychidæ, the last abdominal segment bears a pair of
2–jointed legs (cercopoda),
ending in either
one or two claws, which
under various forms,
sometimes forming long
processes, persist in the
pupa; and there appears
to be a suranal plate, the
vestige of the tenth uromere.
In the pupa,
judging by Klapálek’s
figure of Leptocerus
(24<sub>8,9</sub>, 25), a pair of lateral
spines arise which
may in the imago form one of the pairs of appendages or styles.
In the pupa of <i>Œcetis furva</i> his figure 28<sub>9</sub> shows two pairs of
1–jointed appendages arising from the last segment; whether the
long dorsal or upper styles arise from the vestige of a more distal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>segment is not distinctly shown in Klapálek’s sketch. The origin
of these elements of the genital armature evidently needs further
study.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether the abdominal legs or so-called false or prop-legs of
lepidopterous larvæ are genuine legs, homologous with those of
the thorax and with the cephalic appendages, or whether they are
secondary adaptive structures, is a matter still under discussion.
That, however, they are true legs is shown by the embryology of the
Lepidoptera, where there is a pair to each abdominal segment. It
may also be asked whether the anal legs of lepidopterous larvæ
are not the homologues of the 2–jointed anal appendages of caddis-worms.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In Lepidoptera, notably the male of the very generalized <i>Eriocephala
calthella</i> (Fig. 201), besides the broad unjointed claspers, which
are curved upward and provided with a brush of stiff hooked setæ
(this upper pair being perhaps modified cercopods), there is an
accessory lower slenderer pair, while the suranal plate (<i>t</i>) is palpiform
or clavate and also adapted to aid in the action of the claspers.
The examination of the cercopods and rhabdopods in the Trichoptera
and in a generalized lepidopterous form like this enables one
to understand the morphology of the genital armature, since it
consists, besides the suranal plate, which is often deeply forked (in
Sphingidæ, Smith), of a pair of modified hook-like cercopoda, and
in some cases (Eriocephala) of an additional pair of claspers which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>may be the homologues of the ephemerid rhabdopods. A pair of
hooks, often strong and claw-like (<i>harpes</i>), are situated, one near
the base on the inside of each clasper; they are especially developed
in the Noctuidæ (Smith), and appear to be present in certain Trichoptera,
but this remains to be proved. This complicated apparatus of
claspers and hooks is utilized by those insects which pair while on
the wing, and is wanting in such forms as Coleoptera and Hemiptera.
Besides the forceps of Panorpa, there are two pairs of
slender filiform appendages which need farther examination. In
the Diptera, especially Tipulidæ, there is a pair of 2–jointed appendages
or forceps, as in Limnophila (Osten Sacken). The male genital
armature of Diptera appears to be on the same general plan as in
Lepidoptera, but more complicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notice should also be taken of the paired
uncinate hooks which are modifications of the
penis-sheath of the male of cockroaches (Phyllodromia),
which Haase states appear to originate
on the tenth ventral plate, and which probably
“serve to open and dilate the vagina of the
female, especially as a perforated penis, which
is highly developed in Machilis, seems to be
wanting in the Blattidæ.” (Haase.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The penis.</b>—This is a single or double median
style-like structure either hollow and perforated,
or solid, very variable in shape, receiving the end
of the ejaculatory duct. It is usually enclosed
between two lateral plates, the homologues perhaps
of the inner pair of sheaths of the ovipositor.
In the Coleoptera, as in Carabidæ and
Melolonthidæ, the penis is a long chitinous tube,
“retractile within the abdomen on the under surface as far as the
anterior segments.” (Newport.) In the Hymenoptera, of which
that of the saw-flies is a type, Newport states that it “consists of
a short valvular projectile organ, covered externally by two pointed
horny plates (<i>i</i>) clothed with soft hairs.” Above these are two other
irregular double-jointed plates (Fig. 202, <i>l</i>) surrounded at their base
by a chitinous ring (<i>k</i>); they are edged with prehensile hooked
spines (<i>i</i>). Between these in the middle line are two elongated
muscular parts (<i>m</i>) which enclose the penis (<i>h</i>), and which, like
those in beetles, perhaps aid in dilating the vulva of the female.</p>

<p class='c007'>An examination of Figs. 203–207 will aid in understanding the
various modifications in beetles, etc., of this organ.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>A general study of the anatomy and homologies of the male genital
armature, from a developmental point of view, together with a comparison
of them with the corresponding female organs, is still
needed.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The suranal plate.</b>—This is a triangular, often thick, solid plate

this plate is well marked; in those of the Platypteridæ it is remarkably
elongated, forming an approach to a flagellum-like terrifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>appendage, and in that of <i>Aglia tau</i> it forms a long, prominent,
sharp spine. In the cockroach, both Cholodkowsky and Haase
maintain that the tenth abdominal segment is suppressed in the
female, the tergal portion being fused with the suranal plate (the
latter in this case, as we understand it, being the remnant of
the eleventh segment of the embryo). As to the nature of the
middle jointed caudal appendage in Thysanura and May-flies Heymons
has satisfactorily shown that it is a hypertrophied portion
of the suranal plate, being in Lepisma but a filamental elongation
of the small eleventh abdominal tergite.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The infra-anal lobe.</b>—Our attention was first called to this lobe or
flap, while examining some geometrid larvæ. It is a thick, conical,
fleshy lobe, often ending in a hard, chitinous point, and situated directly
beneath the vent. Its use is evidently to aid in tossing the
pellets of excrement away so as to prevent their contact with the
body. The end may be sharp and hard or bear a bristle. Whether
this lobe is the modified ventral plate of the ninth urite, we will not
undertake at present to say.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>The cuticula.</b>—The integument is externally either smooth and
shining or variously punctured, granulated, tuberculated, striated,
or hairy. In certain orders
the skin is clothed with
flattened setæ or scales,
while many forms, as some
caterpillars (Figs. 208, 209),
beetles (Fig. 210), etc., are
protected by spines, horns,
etc., these in adult insects
often forming secondary
sexual characters, usually being more developed in the males than
in the females.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The cuticula is not always smooth, but is often finely granulated or even
minutely spinulated. On the abdominal segments of Anabrus, as observed by
Minot, the cuticula is armed with
microscopic conical nodules scattered
irregularly over it. They do not
correspond, he says, in any way to
hairs; for they do not rest over
pores, nor did he see any specially
modified cells underlying them. “As
far as I have observed, they are mere
local irregularities, each nodule being
apparently supported by some four
or six unmodified epidermal cells.”
Minot adds that the whole of the cuticula, except the cones just described
and the hairs, is divided into numerous minute fields, each of which corresponds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to a single cell of the underlying hypodermis. Each field is bounded
by a distinct polygonal outline, and its surface is either covered by a large number
of extremely minute projecting points, as on the dorsal arch of the segment,
or is smooth, as upon the articular membrane and ventral
arch. Upon the sides of the dorsal arch and upon
the spiracular membrane each field has a projecting
spine or sometimes two or even three. (See also pp.
28, 30.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The cuticle of lepidopterous larvæ has also been
described and figured by Minot. In the caterpillars
of different groups investigated by him, the cuticle was
found to be rough with microscopic teeth or spinules,
erect or flattened and scale-like, and either densely
crowded or scattered, and affording excellent
generic and specific characters. In
the slug-worms (Limacodids) we have
observed that the cuticula is unusually
rough, especially on the spiniferous
tubercle of Empretia, Parasa, etc. (Fig.
213, <i>c</i>). The skin of the body between
the tubercles is seen to be finely shagreened,
due to the presence of fine teeth,
which are more or less curved and bent,
these teeth arising from a very finely granulated surface (<i>d</i>). The cuticle of
neuropterous, trichopterous, and tenthredinid larvæ will probably afford similar
cases. The integument of the larva of Datana is, on the black bands, rough
and nodulated, the irregular nodules being filled with a black
pigment, and forming a layer (<i>p</i>) external to the true cuticula
(Fig. 211).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The integument of many insects contains fine
canals passing through the chitinous layers and opening
externally in minute pores. Certain of the pore-canals
communicate with hollow setæ which sit
directly over the pores; other pores form the external
openings of dermal glands, but in many cases they
are empty or only filled with air, and do not have
any hairs connected with them. Each of these pores
communicates with a hair-forming hypodermal cell,
called by Graber a <i>trichogen</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Setæ</b> (“hairs” and bristles).—The setæ of insects
are, as in worms, processes of the cuticle originating
from certain of the hypodermal cells. They arise
either from a ring-like pit, or from a minute tubercle,
and are usually situated at the outlet of a pore-canal,
which connects with an underlying cell of the hypodermis
(Fig. 212). They are, then, bristle or hair-like processes
arising from the hypodermis. Where the hairs or setæ are rubbed
off, their site is indicated by a minute ring like a follicle in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>chitinous integument. The cuticular hair, says Leydig, is in its first
condition the secretion of the cellular element of the skin, and a
thread-like continuation of the cell-body may rise up through the
pore-canal into the centre of the hair, remaining there permanently.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the setæ are usually simple, they are often branched,
plumose, or spinulose, as in larval Hemerobiidæ, Anthrenus, and
Dermestes, the larvæ of certain coccinellid beetles, notably Epilachna,
and of Cassida, the larvæ of arctians, etc., and in bees
(Anthophila, Megachile, Osmia, Colletes, Apis, etc.).</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of these spinulose, plumose, and twisted hairs in the bees
is clearly shown by J. B. Smith, who states that as these insects
walk over flowers, the pollen grains adhere to the vestiture, “and
this also accounts for the fact, probably noticed by every observant
fruit-grower, that bees frequently bury themselves completely in the
blossoms, or roll over every part of them. Such insects are after
pollen, not honey, and by so rolling about, the pollen grains are
brought into contact with and adhere to the surface of the insect.”
The syrphid flies also pollenize flowers, the pollenizing of chrysanthemums
being effected, as Smith states, by <i>Eristalis tenax</i>, and he
adds that the body vestiture of the syrphids “is often composed of
spurred and branched hairs.” (For reference to gathering hairs, see
p. 45.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain remarkable spines occur in limacodid larvæ, notably Empretia

their resemblance to the caltrops formerly used in repelling the

poisonous and irritating effects resulting from contact with the caterpillars
of these moths, and are situated in scattered groups near the
end of the tubercles. A group of three is represented at Fig. 213, <i>e</i>.
They are not firmly embedded in the cuticle, but on the contrary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>appear to become very easily loosened and detached, and they probably,
when brought into contact with the skin of any aggressor,
burrow underneath, and are probably in part the cause of the continual
itching and annoyance occasioned by these creatures. It will
be seen by reference to Fig. 213, <i>e′</i>, that the body of the spine is
spherical, with one large, elongated, conical spine arising from it, the
spherical base being beset with a number of minute, somewhat obtuse
spinules.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Glandular hairs and spines.</b>—In some insects occur fine, minute,
hollow setæ from which exude, perhaps through pore-canals of extreme
fineness, droplets of a clear watery or plasma-like sticky fluid.
The club-shaped tenent hairs of the feet of Collembola, and the hairs
fringing the feet of Diptera, are modified glandular hairs. Here
they serve to give out a sticky fluid enabling the insect to walk on
smooth surfaces; they end in a vesicle-like bulbous expansion, which
may contain numerous pore-canals. Those of caterpillars were first
noticed by Zeller, and Dimmock has particularly described those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the larvæ of Pterophoridæ. They are either club-shaped, or variously
forked at the end (Fig. 214, <i>B</i>, <i>a</i>). They are usually replaced
after the first larval moult by ordinary, simple, solid, pointed setæ,
and their use in caterpillars is as yet unknown. Whether these
hairs, as seems most probable, arise from a specialized glandular
hypodermal cell, or not, has not yet been discovered.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id065'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These temporary fine glandular hairs are probably the homologues
of the larger true glandular bristles and spines of the later stages of
certain lepidopterous larvæ, which are brightly colored and lead an
exposed life, living through a large part of the summer. In these
structures the bristles or spines are hollow, filled with a poisonous
secretion formed in a single large, or several smaller specialized
hypodermal cells situated under the base of the spine. In the
venomous spines of <i>Lagoa crispata</i> the poisonous fluid in the larger
spines (Figs. 215, <i>C</i>, 216, <i>b</i>) is secreted in several large cells situated
at the base of the spine, and this is the usual form. In the finer
spines of a large tubercle (Figs. 215, <i>A</i>, 216) there appears to be a
differentiation of the hypodermal cells into two kinds, the large,
basal deep-seated, setigenous cells (216, <i>sc</i>) and the poison-secreting
nuclei (216, <i>pglc</i>) situated nearer the base of the setæ. The spines
being filled with poison and breaking into bits in the skin of the
hands or neck, cause great irritation and smarting. These nettling
or poisonous hairs or spines are especially venomous in the larva of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Orgyia, <i>Empretia stimulea</i>, <i>Hyperchiria io</i>, the larvæ of the saturnians
(Fig. 217) and lasiocampids, etc. They rarely occur in insects of other
orders, though the skin of Telephorus
is said by Leydig to bear
glandular hairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leydig states that in the stout bristles of
Saturnia there is, as in the integument of
the body, a homogeneous cuticula, under
which is the cellular matrix (hypodermis),
and the clear contents (hyaloplasma) are
secreted from the blood. The cell-structure
of the hairs consist, as in the cells of the
body, of spongioplasma and hyaloplasma.
Leydig has observed the droplets of the
secretion of the caterpillar of <i>Saturnia
carpini</i> oozing through distinctly observable
pores, and states that there are similar
openings in the hairs and scales. Dewitz
found easily observable openings at the end
of the hair of a large exotic weevil (Fig. 130).</p>

<p class='c013'>The advanced nymph of Psylla is also

<p class='c013'>The tubercles are outgrowths of the body-walls;
they are either smooth, warty, or

armature of insects is of little morphological

the life of the insect depending upon it; and it varies in each species of insect,

<p class='c007'>The mode of development of the hairs was first described by
Semper. In the pectination of the antenna of <i>Saturnia carpini</i> he
observed that the hairs arise, like the scales of the wings, from large
round formative-cells lying in the cavity, which send out through the
hypodermis and cuticle a long slender process which finally becomes
the hair (Fig. 218).</p>

<p class='c007'>Tactile hairs are those setæ arising over nerve cells or nerve terminations
and will be discussed under the organs of sense.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Scales.</b>—In very rare cases the hairs of caterpillars (Fig. 219) are
flattened and scale-like, and
this passage in the same
insect of cylindrical hairs
into flattened scale-like
ones, shows that the scales
are only modified hairs.
Also, as we shall see farther
on, Semper has proved that
their mode of origin is
identical. While true scales
are characteristic of Synaptera
(Thysanura and Colembola), as well as Lepidoptera and
Trichoptera, they also occur in the Psocidæ (Amphientomum), in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>many Coleoptera (Curculionidæ, Cleridæ, Ptinidæ, Dermestidæ,
Byrrhidæ, Scarabæidæ, Elateridæ, and Cerambycidæ), and in the
Culicidæ, and a few other Diptera, though they are especially characteristic
of the Lepidoptera, not a species of this great order being
known to be entirely destitute of them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The scales vary much in shape, but are more or less tile-like,
attached to the surface
of the body or wing by
a short slender pedicel,
and are more loosely
connected with the integument
than the hairs,
which are thicker at the
base or insertion than
beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>The markings of the
scales, both of Synaptera
and Lepidoptera, are
very elaborate, consisting
of raised lines, ridges, or striæ with transverse ridges between.
“The striæ of the transparent scales of Micropteryx are from about
500 to 300 to the millimetre, varying in different species. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>opaque scales of Morpho, which show metallic reflections, have
about 1400 striæ to the millimetre.” (Kellogg.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The primary use of scales, as observed by Kellogg, is to protect
the body, as seen in Synaptera and Lepidoptera. A nearly as
important use is the production of colors and patterns of colors and
markings, while in certain butterflies certain scales function as the
external openings of dermal scent-glands, and they afford in some
cases (as first claimed by Kettelhoit in 1860) generic and specific
characters. Spuler has shown that the scales are strengthened by
internal chitinous pillars. Burgess has observed in the scales of
<i>Danais plexippus</i> that the under surface of the scales is usually
smooth, or provided with few and poorly developed ridges, and this
has been confirmed by Spuler and by Mayer (Fig. 226).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the irised and metallic scales the ridges, says Spuler, are not
divided into teeth, and they converge at the base to the pedicel and
also toward the end of the scale (Micropteryx), or end in a single
process beyond the middle (the brass-colored scales of <i>Plusia chrysitis</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrangement of the scales on the wings is, in the generalized
moths, irregular; in the more specialized forms they are arranged
in bands forming groups, and in the most specialized Lepidoptera
they are more thickly crowded, overlapping each other and inserted
in regular rows crossing the wings, these rows either uniting with
each other or running parallel. (Spuler.) The scattered irregular
arrangement seen in Micropteryx is also characteristic of the Trichoptera
and of Amphientomum.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Development of the scales.</b>—The mode of origin of the scales was
first worked out by Semper in 1886, who stated that in the wing of
the pupal Sphinx and Saturnia they are seen, in sections, to arise
from large roundish cells just under the hypodermis and which
have a projection which passes out between the hypodermis (his
“epidermis”) cells, expanding into a more or less spherical vesicle,
the latter being the first indication of the future scale. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>observed that the scales are not all formed at once, but arise one
after another, so that on one and the same wing the scales are in
different stages of development.</p>

<div  class='figleft id020'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 225.</span>—Portion of a longitudinal section through a pupal wing about eight days before emergence: <i>s</i>, formative scale-cell; upper <i>s</i>, a scale.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>More recently Schaeffer has stated that the scales and also the
hairs are evaginations of greatly enlarged hypodermis cells, and still
more complete evidence has been afforded by A. G. Mayer (1896).
In the wings of Lepidoptera, about three weeks before the imago
emerges, certain of the hypodermis cells, which occur at regular intervals,
begin to increase in size and to project slightly above the level of
the hypodermis; these are Semper’s “formative cells,” and are destined
to secrete the scales. They increase in length, and appear as
in Fig. 223. In the next stage observed, the projections are much
longer (Fig. 224). The hypodermis
is now thrown up into a regular
series of ridges, which run across
the wing. Each ridge, says Mayer,
corresponds in position with a row
of formative cells, and each furrow
with the interval between two adjacent
rows. The scales always
project from the tops of these
ridges. The ground or basal membrane
has not participated in this
folding, and the deep processes of
the hypodermis (<i>prc</i>) that once
extended to this membrane have
largely disappeared. Figure 225
represents a more advanced stage
almost eight days before the emergence
of the imago.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scales are originally filled with protoplasm, which gradually
withdraws, leaving behind it little chitinous bars or pillars which
serve to bind together the upper and lower surfaces of the scales,
and finally the scales become “merely little flattened hollow sacs
containing only air.” As Mayer shows (Figs. 226, 227), from the
study of scales examined four days before emergence of the butterfly
(Danais), “the striations upon the upper surface of the scale are
due to a series of parallel longitudinal ridges,” while the under side
is usually smooth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of insertion is seen in Fig. 227. The narrow cylindrical
pedicel of the scale is merely, according to Semper, inserted into
a minute close-fitting socket, which perforates the wing-membrane,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>and not into a tube, as Landois supposed. Spuler describes a sort
of double sac structure or follicle (<i>Schuppenbalg)</i> which receives the
hollow pedicel of the scale. This was originally (1860) observed by
F. J. Carl Mayer, but more fully examined by Spuler (Fig. 228)
though not detected by A. G. Mayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Spinules, hair-scales, hair-fields, and androconia.</b>—Besides the
scales, fine spinules occur on the thickened veins of the wings of
the Blattidæ, where they resemble fir-cones; also in the Perlidæ, in
the Trichoptera, and in the more generalized Lepidoptera (Micropterygidæ
and Hepialidæ), occur, as indicated by Spuler, delicate
chitinous hollow spinules scarcely one-tenth as long as, and more
numerous than, the scales, which sometimes form what he calls
“Haftfelds,” or holding areas. These spinules have also been
noticed by Kellogg, and by myself in Micropteryx; Kellogg, and
also Spuler, have observed them in certain Trichoptera (Hydropsyche).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>These also occur on the veins, and detached ones near
large one-jointed hairs, or hair-scales, said by Kellogg to be striated.
Kellogg has detected these scale-hairs, as he calls them, in
Panorpa.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The “hair-scales” of the phylogenetically older Trichoptera correspond
to certain scales of Lepidoptera, especially the Psychidæ
(Spuler), variously called “plumules” (Deschamps), “battledore
scales,” also certain minute cylindrical hairs. To these scent-scales
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>is applied the term <i>androconia</i>. They are found, almost without
exception, on the upper side of the fore wings, occurring in limited
areas, such as the discal spots, or on folds of the wings. Fritz
Müller has shown that they function as scent-scales, and are confined
to the males. Kellogg has detected androconia-like scales on
the wings of a caddis-fly, <i>Mystacides punctata</i> (Fig. 229).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thomas has proved by sections of the wing of Danais, etc., that
the androconia arise from glands situated in a fold of the wing
(Fig. 230), and he states
that the material elaborated
by the local glands,
and distributed upon the
surface of the wing by
the androconia, is that
which gives to many of
the Lepidoptera their
characteristic odor. On
comparing these
“glands,” it is evident
that they are groups of
specialized formative
cells of Semper (trichogens),
which secrete an odorous fluid, issuing perhaps from extremely
fine pore-canals at the ends of the androconia. They thus correspond
to the glandular hairs, poison-hairs, and spines of caterpillars,
the formative cells of which contain either a clear lymph or poison.</p>

<h3 class='c002'>THE COLORS OF INSECTS</h3>
<p class='c006'>The colors and bright markings of insects, especially those of
butterflies, render them the most brilliant and beautiful creatures
in existence, rivalling and even excelling the gay hues of our most
splendidly colored birds. The subject has been but recently taken
up and is in a somewhat crude condition, but the leading features
have been roughly sketched out by the work of a few observers from
a physical, chemical, and biological point of view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The colors of insects, as of all other animals, are primarily due to
the action of light and air; other factors are, as Hagen observes,
heat and cold, moisture and dryness, as recently shown by the experiments
on butterflies by Dorfmeister, Weismann, W. H. Edwards,
and later observers. They have their seat in the integument.
Hagen divides colors into optical and natural.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Optical colors.</b>—“These,” says Hagen, “are produced by the interference
of light, and are by no means rare among insects, but they
are solely optical phenomena. Colors by the interference of light
are produced in two different ways: either by thin superposed
lamellæ, or by many very fine lines or small impressions in very
close juxtaposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. There must be present at least two superposed lamellæ to produce
colors by interference. The naked wings of Diptera, of dragon-flies,
and of certain Neuroptera often show beautiful interference
colors. The wings of Chrysopa and Agrion show interference colors
only for a certain time, viz., as long as the membranes of the wings
are soft and not firmly glued together. Afterwards such wings become
simply hyaline.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“The scales of Entimus and other Curculionidæ are well known for their
brilliancy, and it is interesting to remark that when dry scales are examined with
the microscope, many are found partly injured, which give in different places
different colors, according to the number of layers which remain. The elytra
of some Chrysomelina and other beetles with iridescent colors probably belong
to the same category.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. When there are scales with many fine lines or small impressions
close to each other, we have the second mode of producing
colors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fine longitudinal and transversal lines of lepidopterous
scales seem to serve admirably well to produce the brilliant effect
of color-changing butterflies. But there must be something more
present, as most of the scales of Lepidoptera are provided with
similarly fine lines, and only comparatively few species change
colors. I remark purposely that the lines in the color-changing
scales are not in nearer juxtaposition.” (Hagen.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“The colors of butterflies change mostly from purple to blue, sometimes to
yellow. The splendid violet color at the end of the wings of <i>Callosune ione</i> is
brought out by a combination of the natural with interference colors. Originally
the scales are colored lake-red; but a blue interference color is mixed with
it; hence the violet hue results. The blue tones, <i>i.e.</i> the splendid varying blue
of the Morpho butterflies, Schatz claims, owe their hue less to the interference
of light than to a clouded layer of scales situated over the dark ground, through
which the light becomes reflected on the same. The scales of the Morphids are
in reality brown, as we see by transmitted light; moreover, only the upper side
of the scales sends off blue reflections—the under side is simply brown. But
the blue scales of Urvilliana are also shining blue beneath; by transmitted
light they appear as if clear yellow. The smaragd-green scales of Priamus
show by transmitted light a bright red-orange, and the orange-yellow of Crœsus
a deep grass-green.” (Schatz in Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“Krukenberg presumes the golden-green color of <i>Carabus auratus</i> to be an
interference color. It is not changed by the interference of light, nor was he
able to extract from the elytra any green pigment with ether, benzol, carbon
of sulphur, chloroform, or alcohol, even after having previously submitted the
elytra to the influence of muriatic acid or ammonia. Chlorophyll is not present,
whether free or combined with an acid.” (Hagen.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Leydig has shown that the interference colors of the hairs of certain worms
(Aphrodite and Eunice) may be produced by very small impressions in juxtaposition,
which bring about the same effect as striæ. Such an arrangement
occurs on the feathers of birds, <i>i.e.</i> on the necks of pigeons and elsewhere, and
Hagen suggests that this kind of interference colors occurs more frequently
among insects than is commonly known. At least the limbs of certain forms
appear yellow, but when held in a certain position change to brown or blackish.
“I know of no other explanation of this not uncommon fact on the legs of
Diptera, of Hymenoptera, and of Phryganidæ.” Interference colors, he adds,
may occur in the same place together with natural colors. “The mirror spots
of <i>Saturnia pernyi</i> show besides the interference colors a white substance in the
cells of the matrix, which Leydig believes to be guanin. But this fact is denied
by Krukenberg for the same species and also for <i>Attacus mylitta</i> and <i>Plusia
chrysitis</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span><b>Natural colors.</b>—These are divided by Hagen into <i>dermal</i> (cuticular)
and <i>hypodermal</i>. The dermal colors are due to pigment deposited
in the form of very small nuclei in the cuticula. Hagen
considers them as “produced mostly by oxidation or carbonization,
in consequence of a chemical process originating and accompanying
the development and the transformations of insects.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To a certain extent the dermal colors may have been derived from hypodermal
colors, as the cuticula is secreted by the hypodermis, and the colors
may have been changed by oxidation and air-tight seclusion. The cuticula is in
certain cases entirely colorless,—so in the green caterpillar of <i>Sphinx ocellata</i>;
but the intensely red and black spots of the caterpillar of <i>Papilio machaon</i> belong
to the cuticula, and only the main yellow color of the body to the hypodermis.”
(Leydig, Histiol., p. 114.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dermal colors are red, brown, black, and all intermediate
shades, and all metallic colors, blue, green, bronze, copper, silver,
and gold. The dermal colors are easily to be recognized as such,
because they are persistent, never becoming obliterated or changed
after death.” (Hagen.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Minot and Burgess refer to the cuticular colors of the cotton-worm (Aletia),
the dark brown color belonging to the cuticula or crust. “Upon the outside of
the crust is a very thin but distinct layer, which in certain parts rises up into a
great number of minute, pointed spines that look like so many dots in a surface
view. Each spine is pigmented diffusely, and together they produce the brown
markings. The spines are clustered in little groups, one group over each underlying
hypodermal cell.” (U. S. Ent. Comm., 4th Report, p. 46.) Minot also
shows that in caterpillars generally a part of the coloration is caused by pigmentation
of the cuticula.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a dull-colored insect, such as the Mormon cricket (Anabrus), the coloration,
as Minot states, depends principally upon the pigment of the hypodermis
shining through the cuticula. “Most of the cells contain dull, reddish-brown
granules, but scattered in among them are patches of cells bright green in
color. I have observed no cells intermediate in color; on the contrary, the
passage is abrupt, a brown or red cell lying next a green one. Indeed, I have
never seen any microscopic object more bizarre than a piece of the epidermis of
Anabrus spread out and viewed from the surface.” (2d Report U. S. Ent.
Comm., p. 189.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The pigment may extend through the entire cuticula, but it is
usually confined to the outermost layers, and occurs there in union
with a peculiar modelling of the upper surface into microscopic figures
which are of interest not only from their delicacy, but because
they vary with each species. (See p. 184.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypodermal colors, situated in the hypodermis, are, according
to Hagen, the result of a chemical process, generating color out of
substances contained in the body. They are easily recognized, since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>they fade, change, and disappear after death. But where these
colors are preserved after death and enclosed in air-tight sacs, as in
the elytra and scales and hairs of the body, they persist, though, as
we well know, they may fade after exposure to light.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hypodermal colors are mostly brighter and lighter than the
dermal ones, being light blue or green in different shades, yellow to
orange, and the numerous shades of these colors combined with
white; exceptionally they are metallic, as in Cassida, and are then
obliterated after death.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fact that such metallic colors can be retained in dead specimens by
putting a drop of glycerine under the elytra, leads us to conclude that those
colors are based upon fat substances. The hypodermal colors are never glossy,
as far as I know; the dermal colors frequently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the wings, elytra, and hairs all possess a cuticula, dermal colors are frequently
to be found, together with hypodermal ones, chiefly in metallic colors.
In the same place both colors may be present, or one of them alone. So we
find hypodermal colors in the elytra of Lampyridæ. In the elytra of the
Cicindelidæ the main metallic color is dermal, the white lines or spots are hypodermal,
by which arrangement the variability in size and shape of those spots is
explained.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There occur in a number of insects external colors, that is, colors upon the
cuticula, which I consider to be in fact displaced hypodermal colors: the mealy
pale blue or white upon the abdomen of some Odonata, the white on many
Hemiptera, the pale gray on the elytra and on the thorax of the Goliath beetle,
and the yellowish powder on Lixus. Some of these colors dissolve easily by
ether or melt in heat, and some of them are a kind of wax. I believe that those
colors are produced in the hypodermis, and are exuded through the pore-canals.”
(Hagen.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The white colors are simply for the most part due to the inclusion
of air in scales. The white mother-of-pearl spots of Argynnis are
produced by a system of fine transverse pore-canals filled with air; in
Hydrometra the white ventral marks have the same origin. (Leydig.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The further statements and criticisms of Hagen regarding the
relation of color to mimicry, sexual selection, and the origin of patterns
are of much weight and will be referred to under those heads.
Indeed, these subjects cannot well be discussed without reference to
the fundamental facts stated in the masterly papers of Leydig and
of Hagen, and much of the theorizing of these latter days is ill-founded,
because the colors of insects and animals are attributed to
natural selection, when they seem really the result of the action of
the primary factors of organic evolution, such as changes of light,
heat, cold, and chemical processes dependent on the former.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the chemical nature of color, Hagen, after quoting the results
of Krukenberg and others, thinks that the colors of insects are
chemically produced by a combination of fats or fat-acids with other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>acids or alkalis under the influence of air, light, and heat. He concludes:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That some colors of insects can be changed or obliterated by
acids.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That two natural colors, madder-lake and indigo, can be produced
artificially by the influence of acid on fat-bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. As protein bodies in insects are changed into fat-bodies, and
may be changed by acids contained in insects into fat-acids, the formation
of colors in the same manner seems probable.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That colors can be changed by different temperatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. That the pattern is originated probably by a combination of
oxygen with the integument.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. That mimicry of the hypodermal colors may be effected by a
kind of photographic process.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Finally, color and pattern are produced by physiological processes
in the interior of the bodies of insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>Krukenberg concludes that change of color (in perfectly developed insects)
is a consequence of the change of food, and can be explained by the alteration
of the pigment through heat and light. His experiments were made in order
to ascertain the cause of the turning of green grasshoppers in autumn into yellow
and pink. He tried to answer two questions: First, does the pigment of
grasshoppers originate directly out of the food, and does it consist of pure
chlorophyll or of a substance containing chlorophyll, or is it to be accepted as
a peculiar product of the organism? Second, is the color the consequence of
only one pigment, or of several? Special analysis proves that the green color
has no connection with chlorophyll. He concludes: “It is evident that the
green color of the grasshopper is the consequence of several different pigments
which can be separated by a chemical process.” Krukenberg believes that light
has a marked influence on the color of insects and that light turns to red or
pink the insects which were green during the summer. It would seem, however,
more probable that cold was the agent, the change being due to the colder
autumn weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here we might refer to the results of the studies of Buckton and Sorby, on
the changes in color of Aphides:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“1. The purple coloring matter appears to be a quasi-living principle, and
not a product of a subsequent chemical oxidizing process. Mounted in balsam
or other preserving fluids, the darker species stain the fluid a fine violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“2. As autumn approaches and cold weather reduces the activity of the
Aphides, the lively greens and yellows commonly become converted into ferruginous
red, and even dark brown, which last hue in reality partakes more or less
of intense violet or purple. These changes have some analogy with the brilliant
hues assumed by maple and other leaves during the process of slow decay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“3. Aqueous solutions of crushed dark brown and yellow-green varieties of
Aphides originate different colors with acids and alkalies.</p>

<p class='c013'>“4. In the generality of cases coloring-matters, such as indigo, Indian yellow,
madder-lake, and the like, do not separately exist in the substance of vegetables,
but the pigments are disengaged through fermentation or oxygenation.
Again, alizarin itself is reddish yellow, but alkaline solutions strike it a rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>violet just as we find them to act towards the substance which Mr. Sorby calls
aphidilutein.</p>

<p class='c013'>“5. Mr. Sorby’s four stages of the changes effected by the oxidation of
aphideine produce four different substances.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Chemical and physical nature of the pigment.</b>—Researches in this
difficult field of inquiry have been made by Landois (1864), Sorby
(1871), Meldola (1871), by Krukenberg (1884), and more recently
by Coste, Urech, Hopkins, and Mayer, and the subject is of fundamental
importance in dealing with mimicry and protective coloration,
the primary causes of which appear to be due to the action of
physical and chemical agents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Over twenty years ago Meldola observed that the yellow pigment
of the sulphur-yellow butterfly (<i>Gonopteryx rhamni</i>) was soluble in
water, and showed that its aqueous solution had an acid reaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides the yellow uranidin found by Krukenberg in different beetles and
lepidopterous pupæ, still other coloring-matters, which are very constant in different
species are readily recognized by the spectroscope. “Thus there appear
in the brownish yellow lymph of <i>Attacus pernyi</i>, <i>Callosamia promethea</i> and
<i>Telea polyphemus</i>, after saponification of the precipitated soap readily effected
by ether, or incompletely or not removed by benzine, a chlorophane-like lipochrome;
and in the yellowish green lymph of <i>Saturnia pyri</i> and of <i>Platysamia
cecropia</i> besides this pigment still another whose spectrum shows a broad band
on D, but which disappears with the addition of acetic acid or ammonia, as also
after a long heating of the lymph up to 66° C.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Coste, and more especially Urech, have shown that many of the
pigments may be dissolved out of the scales by means of chemical
reagents, giving colored solutions, and leaving the scales white or
colorless. They have also shown that some of these pigments may
be changed in color by the action of reagents, and then restored to
their original color by other reagents. They have proved that reds,
yellows, browns, and blacks are always due to pigments, and in a
few cases greens, blues, violets, purples, and whites, and not, as is
usually the case, to structural conditions, such as striæ on the scales
(Mayer). They confined themselves solely to the chemical side of
the problem, not considering the structure of the scales themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Urech has also discovered a beautiful smaragd-green coloring-matter
in the wings (not in the scales) of the pupa of <i>Pieris
brassicæ</i>. It is not chlorophyll, and Urech suggests that it may be
either the germinal substance of the pigments of the scales or its
bearer. It is not the pigment of the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Urech has also demonstrated that in many Lepidoptera the color
of the urine which is voided upon emergence from the chrysalis is
similar to the principal color of the scales.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Hopkins has worked on the pigments within the scales of butterflies. The
yellow pigment in <i>Gonopteryx rhamni</i> is a derivation of uric acid, and he calls
it lepidotic acid. Its aqueous solution is strongly acid to litmus, and must be
bad-tasting to birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hopkins has dissolved the red pigment from the border of the hind wing of
<i>Delias eucharis</i>, an Indian butterfly, in pure water, finding as the result a yellow
solution; but if the solution be evaporated to dryness, the solid residue of
pigment is red once more. He has obtained from this pigment of <i>eucharis</i> a
silver compound which contains a percentage of metals exactly equal to that
from the pigment of <i>G. rhamni</i>. (Nature, April 2, 1892.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“The scales of the wings of the white butterflies (Pieridæ) are also shown
by Hopkins to contain uric acid, this substance practically acting as a white
pigment in these insects. A yellow pigment, widely distributed in the same
family, is shown to be a derivative of uric acid, and its artificial production
as a by-product of the hydrolysis of uric acid is demonstrated. That this yellow
pigment is an ordinary excretory product of the butterfly is indicated by the
fact that an identical substance is voided from the rectum on emergence from
the pupa. These excretory pigments, which have well-marked reactions, are
apparently confined to the Pieridæ, and are not found in other Rhopalocera.
This fact shows that when a Pierid mimics an insect belonging to another group,
the pigments of the mimicked and mimicking insects, respectively, are chemically
quite distinct. Other pigments existing, not in the scales, but between the
wing-membranes, are shown to be of use for ornament.” (Proc. Royal Soc.,
London, 1894.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Griffiths (1892) claims that the green pigment found in several species of
Papilio, Hesperia, and Limenitis, also in Noctuidæ, Geometridæ, and Sphingidæ
likewise consists of a derivative of uric acid, which he calls lepidopteric acid.
By prolonged boiling in HCl it is converted into uric acid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Spuler, however, finds that green does not depend on pigmentation, but is an
optical color. As remarked by Spuler, either the chitin of the scales itself is
colored reddish (yellow grayish), or the pigment is secreted in the nuclei.</p>

<p class='c007'>A. G. Mayer believes that the pigments of the scales are derived
from the hæmolymph or blood of the pupa, for the following
reasons: (1) He is unable to find anything but blood within
the scales during the time when the pigment is formed. (2) In
Lepidoptera generally the first color to appear upon the pupal
wings is a dull ochre-yellow, or drab, and this is also the color
assumed by the blood when it is removed from the pupa and exposed
to the air. (3) He has succeeded by artificial means in manufacturing
several pigments from the blood which are similar in
color to various markings upon the wing of the imago; chemical
reagents have the same effect upon these manufactured pigments
that they do upon the similarly colored pigments of the wings. “It
should be here noted,” he says, “that in 1866 Landois pointed out
the fact that the color of the dried blood of many caterpillars is
similar to the ground color of the wings of the mature insect.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of colors.</b>—The colors of
the wings of Lepidoptera, as is well known, are acquired at the end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of the pupal state. The order of development of the colors in the
pupal wings has been observed by Schaeffer, Van Bemmelen, Urech,
Haase, Dixey, Spuler, and A. G. Mayer. The immature wings are
at first transparent and full of protoplasm. The transparent condition
of the wings corresponds to the period before the scales are
formed, and when they are full of protoplasm; they then become
whitish as the scales develop; the latter are at first filled with protoplasm,
and afterwards turn whitish, being little hollow sacks filled
with air. After the protoplasm has completely withdrawn from the
scales, the blood of the pupa enters them, and then the coloring-matter
forms. (Mayer.) He adds that “about twenty-four hours
after the appearance of the dull yellow suffusion the mature colors
begin to show themselves. They arise, faint at first, in places near
the centre of the wings, and are distinguished by the fact that they
first appear upon areas between the nervures, never upon the
nervures themselves. Indeed, the last place to acquire the mature
coloration are the outer and costal edges of the wings, and the
nervures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The faint color of the scales gradually increases in intensity.
“For example, if a scale be destined to become black, it first becomes
pale grayish brown, and this color gradually deepens into black.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Urech states that in <i>Vanessa io</i> first a white, and in <i>V. urticæ</i> a
pale reddish hue, are spread over the entire wings, and then successively
arise other colors in the following order: yellow, yellow
to brown, red, brown and black.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spuler, however, claims that the differentiation of colors and
markings do not follow one another, but arise simultaneously, and
that his view is confirmed by Fischer. This may be the case with
the highly specialized and diversely marked butterflies, but certainly
taking the Lepidoptera as a whole the yellows and drabs must have
been the primitive hues, the other colors being gradually added in
the later more specialized forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is noticeable that the most generalized moths, such as the species
of Micropteryx, Tinea, Psychidæ, Hepialidæ (in general), etc., are dull
brown or yellow-drab without bars, stripes, or spots of bright hues.
These shades prevail in others of the more primitive Lepidoptera,
such as many bombycine moths, and they even appear to a slight extent
in certain caddis-flies. The authors mentioned, especially Mayer,
whom we quote, claim that “dull ochre-yellows and drabs are, phylogenetically
speaking, the oldest pigmental colors in the Lepidoptera;
for these are the colors that are assumed by the hæmolymph
upon mere exposure to the air. The more brilliant pigmental colors,

chemical processes. We find that dull ochre-yellow and drabs are
at the present day the prevalent colors among the less differentiated
nocturnal moths. The diurnal forms of Lepidoptera have almost a
monopoly of the brilliant colorations, but even in these diurnal
forms one finds that dull yellow or drab colors are still quite common
upon those parts of their wings that are hidden from view.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The more primitive moths being more or less uniformly yellowish
or drab, the next step was the formation of bars, stripes, finally spots,
and eyed spots, these markings in the later forms appearing simultaneously
in one and the same species of certain highly specialized
moths and butterflies. All that has been said will prepare the
reader for the consideration of the subject of insect coloration.
The origin of such markings has been discussed by Weismann,
Eimer, Haase, Dixey, Fischer, and others.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>2. INTERNAL ANATOMY</h3>
</div>

<h3 class='c002'>THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM</h3>
<p class='c006'>In its general arrangement the muscular system of insects corresponds
to the segmented structure of the body. Of the muscles
belonging to a single segment, some extend from the front edge of
one segment to that of the next behind it, and others to the hinder
edge; there are also sets of dorsal and ventral muscles passing in an
oblique or vertical course (Figs. 16–18). As Lang observes, “the
greater part of the muscles of the body can be traced back to a paired
system of dorsal and ventral intersegmental longitudinal muscles.”
The muscular system is simplest in larval insects, such as caterpillars,
where the musculature is serially repeated in each segment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larva of Cossus Lyonet found on one side of the body 217
dorsal, 154 lateral, 369 ventral, and in the thoracic legs 63, or 803
muscles in all. “Adding to this number the 12 small muscles of the
second segment, and 8 others of the third, which he did not describe,
there would be for all the muscles on one side of the caterpillar 823.
This would make for the entire body 1646, without counting a
small single muscle which occurs in the subdivision of the last segment,”
and also those of the internal organs as well as those of the
head, so that the total number probably amounts to about 2000, not
3000, as usually stated in the books. Lubbock admits that Lyonet
was right in his mode of estimating the number. In the larva of
<i>Pygærci bucephala</i> he found that “the large muscles scarcely vary at
all,” though certain smaller ones are very variable. Lubbock observed
that certain of the longitudinal muscles in the caterpillar of
Diloba split up into numerous, not less than ten, separate fascicles.
“This separation of the fibres composing a muscle into separate fascicles
is carried on to a much greater extent in the larvæ of Coleoptera.
Of course in the imago the number of thoracic muscles is
greatly increased, or at least in Dyticus and the wood-feeding
Lamellicorns, which alone I have examined. In these two groups
each of the larger muscles is represented by at least twenty separate
fascicles, which makes it far more difficult to distinguish the arrangement
of the muscles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The muscles are whitish or colorless and transparent, those in the
thorax being yellowish or pale brown; and of a soft, almost gelatinous
consistence. In form they are simply flat and thin, straight,
band-like, or in rare cases pyramidal, barrel or feather shaped.
They act variously as rotators, elevators, depressors, retractors, protractors,
flexors, and extensors.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our knowledge of the muscular system of insects is still very imperfect. To
work it out thoroughly one should begin first with that of Scolopendrella, then
some generalized synapterous
form, as Japyx or
Lepisma, then passing to
that of a caterpillar, and
ending with some of the
more highly specialized
forms, such as a beetle,
etc. Thus far our knowledge
is confined to that of
the caterpillars (Lyonet,
Newport, and Lubbock)
and the beetle (Straus-Durckheim)
and ants
(Forel, Lubbock, and
Janet).</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Musculature of a caterpillar.</b>—Newport’s
account
of that of the larva
of <i>Sphinx ligustri</i> is the
most useful (Fig. 231).
The muscles here present,
he says, great uniformity
of size and distribution in
every segment, the motions
of each of these divisions
of the body being almost
precisely similar, especially
in the 4th to 9th trunk segments.
In these segments
the first layer seen on
removing the fat and viscera
are the flat straight
recti muscles. They are
the most powerful of all
the trunk muscles, and are
those which are most concerned
in shortening the
body, in effecting the duplicature
of the external teguments
during the changes
of the insect, and which
during the larval state
mainly assist in locomotion. There are four sets, two dorsal and two ventral
(Fig. 231, <i>A</i>, <i>A</i>). Without entering into farther details, the reader is referred
to the works of Newport and to Fig. 231.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Musculature of a beetle.</b>—The best general account of the musculature of a
perfect insect is that of Straus-Durckheim in his famous work on the Melolontha.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>We will copy the summary of Newport, who adopted the nomenclature applied
to these parts by Burmeister:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The muscles that connect the head with the thorax are contained within
the prothorax (Fig. 232, 2), and are of three kinds, extensors, flexors, and
retractors. The extensors, <i>levatores capitis</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>), consist of two pairs, one of
which arises from the middle line of the pronotum, and diverging laterally from
its fellow of the opposite side, passes directly forwards, and is inserted by a
narrow tendon into the anterior superior margin of the occipital foramen. The
other arises further back from the prophragma. It is a long, narrow muscle
that passes directly forwards through the prothorax, and is inserted by a tendon
near the superior median line of the foramen; so that, while this muscle and its
fellow of the opposite side elevate the head almost in a straight line, the one first
described, when acting alone or singly, draws the head a little on one side; but
when the whole of these muscles act in unison, they simply elevate the head
upon the prothorax. The depressors or flexors, <i>depressores capitis</i> (<i>b</i>), are
exceedingly short muscles, which arise from the jugular plate, or, when that
part does not exist, from the border of the prosternum, and are attached to the
inferior margin of the occipital foramen. They simply flex the head on the prothorax.
The lateral flexors, <i>depressores externi</i> (<i>d</i>), are two little muscles that
arise from the same point as the preceding, and are attached to the lateral inferior
margin of the occipital foramen. The rotatory muscles, <i>rotatores capitis</i> (<i>c</i>),
are two flat muscles like the elevators, which arise, one at the side of the antefurca
and the other from the posterior jugular plate, and passing upwards and
outwards are attached to the lateral margin of the occipital foramen. The
<i>retractor</i> or flexor of the jugular plate is a small muscle (<i>e</i>) that arises from the
margin of the antefurca, and passing directly forwards is inserted by a small
tendon into the middle of the jugular piece. The <i>oblique extensor</i> of the jugular
plate is a long, slender muscle (<i>f</i>) that arises from the external margin of the
pronotum, and passing obliquely downwards and forwards traverses the prothorax
and is inserted by a narrow tendon to the jugular plate immediately before
the retractor. The other retractor (<i>g</i>) arises from the anterior superior boundary
of the pronotum, and passing downwards is inserted into the jugular plate
between the larger levator and <i>flexor capitis</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The muscles proper to the prothorax consist of four pairs, by which it is
united to the succeeding segments. The first of these, the superior retractor,
<i>retractor prothoracis superior</i> (<i>h</i>), arises by a broad, fleshy head from the
anterior external margin of the pronotum, and passing directly backwards is
inserted by a tendon into the prophragma, a little on one side of the median line.
The next muscle of importance, the inferior retractor (<i>i</i>), arises from the anterior
border of the medifurca, and is united to the posterior of the antefurca, thus
forming with that muscle part of the great recti of the larva. This muscle must
be considered as the proper depressor of the prothorax. The <i>elevator prothoracis</i>
(<i>k</i>) is narrow, pyramidal, and arises fleshy from the lateral surface of the
prophragma. It passes downwards and is attached by a narrow tendon to the
superior portion of the antefurca. The <i>rotatores prothoracis</i> are the largest of
all the muscles of this segment. They arise, one on each side (<i>l</i>), by a narrow
head from the posterior part of the pronotum, and passing beneath the prophragma
are considerably enlarged and attached to the tegument between the
two segments, and also to the anterior portion of the mesothorax. The remaining
muscle proper to the prothorax is the closer of the spiracle, an exceedingly
small muscle not shown in the drawing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The other muscles of this segment are those of the legs, which are of considerable
size. There are three distinct flexors of the coxa (<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>). The first of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>these arises from the superior lateral border of the pronotum, the second from
the superior posterior border, the third from the sides of the prothorax, and the
fourth a little nearer posteriorly, and the whole of them are attached by narrow
tendons to the sides of the coxa. But there is only one extensor muscle to this
part. In like manner, the extensor of the trochanter is formed of three portions
(Fig. 233, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>); but there is only one flexor (<i>d</i>), and one abductor (<i>e</i>). In
the femur, there is one extensor (<i>f</i>),—a
long penniform muscle that occupies
the superior part of the thigh, and is
attached by a tendon to the anterior-posterior
margin of the joint formed by
the end of the tibia. There is also but
one flexor (<i>g</i>) in the femur, which, like
the preceding muscle, is penniform, and
occupies the inferior portion of the
femur, and its tendon is attached to the
inferior border of the tibia. In the tibia
itself there is also one flexor and one
extensor. The <i>flexor</i> (<i>i</i>) occupies the
superior portion of the limb, and ends in
a long tendon (<i>l</i>) that passes directly
through the joints of the tarsus, on their
inferior surface, and is attached to the
inferior margin of the claw (<i>g</i>). The
<i>extensor</i> (<i>h</i>) occupies the inferior portion
of the tibia, and is shorter than the preceding
muscle, like which it ends in a
long tendon that is attached to the upper
margin of the claw. Besides these muscles,
which are common to the joints of
the tarsus, there are two others belonging
to the claw, situated in the last joint.
The first of these, the <i>extensor</i> (<i>m</i>), is
short, and occupies the superior portion
of the last phalanx of the tarsus, and the
other, the <i>flexor</i> (<i>n</i>), is a much longer
penniform muscle, which occupies nearly
the whole of the upper and under surface
of the posterior part of the phalanx, and
is attached, like the long flexor of the
tarsus, to the inferior part of the claw.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In describing the minute structure of the muscles of ants, wasps,
and bees, C. Janet states that each consists of a group of fibres
diverging from a tendon, which is an integumentary invagination
(Fig. 236). Each fibre may be regarded as a multinucleate cell;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the sarcolemma represents the cell-membrane. It forms a resistant
and extremely elastic tube. The longitudinal (Fig. 236, <i>E</i>) and
radiating filaments or reticulum (spongioplasm of Gehuchten) lie in
a nutritive filling substance (the hyaloplasm of Gehuchten). The
radiating filaments are formed of an exceedingly elastic substance,
and serve to sustain the longitudinal filaments, to transmit the nervous
stimulus to them, and to bring them back into position after
contraction. Janet’s account agrees on the whole with that of
Gehuchten.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The muscles of flight are said to be penetrated by fine tracheal
branches, probably to supply a greater amount of oxygen, as the
most energetic movements of the insect are made in moving the
wings during flight; while the other muscles of the body are only
surrounded by the air-tubes. (Sharp.)</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>weakest insects pull at least five times their own weight; many of
them, however, get the better of a burden twelve to twenty fold as
heavy as themselves, while a strong man or a draught horse, for
example, is not even able to pull a burden which is equal to the
weight of his body. Plateau came to the following results as to the
relation of the weight of the body to the load drawn (1 and 2 are to
be compared with each other, 1 being the larger, and 2 the smaller
insect; it will be seen that the smaller insect is the stronger).</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The nervous system as a whole</h4>

<div  class='figcenter id076'>
<img src='images/i_240.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 239.</span>—Central nervous system of <i>Machilis maritima</i>: <i>au</i>, eye; <i>lo</i>, optic tract; <i>g</i>, brain; <i>an</i>, antennal nerve; <i>oe</i>, œsophagus passing between the œsophageal commissures; <i>usg</i>, infraœsophageal ganglion; I-III, thoracic ganglia; 1–8, abdominal ganglia, the last (<i>Sabc</i>) consisting of three fused ganglia; <i>s</i>, sympathetic nervous system of the ventral cord.—After Oudemans, from Lang.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The nervous system of insects consists
of a double series or chain of ganglia connected
by nervous cords or commissures.
The first of these is the brain or supraœsophageal
ganglion; it is situated in the
upper part of the head, above the gullet
or œsophagus, while the rest of the system,
called the ventral cord, lies on the
floor of the body, under the digestive
canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>A ganglion or nerve-centre consists of
a mass of ganglion-cells, from each of
which a process or fibre passes off, uniting
with others to form a nerve; by means of
these nerves the ganglia are connected
with other ganglia, and with the sensory
cells and muscle-fibres. The ganglia may
be simple, and arranged in pairs, corresponding
to each segment of the body,
or they may be compound, the result of
the fusion of several pairs of ganglia,
which in the early stages of the embryo
are separate. Thus the brain of insects
is a compound ganglion, or ganglionic
mass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nerves are of two kinds: 1. <i>Sensory</i>,
which transmit sensations from the
peripheral sense-cells to the ganglion, or
brain; 2. <i>Motor</i>, which send stimuli from
the brain or any other ganglion to the
muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of ganglion cells, some are tactile, and
others give rise to nerves of special sense,
being distributed to the eyes, or to the
organs of hearing, smell, taste, or touch.</p>

From each of these ganglia, two nerves are sent under the crop, and a larger nerve on each side to as far as the stomachal cæca, ending the figure at the dotted line 2, near the second thoracic ganglion. <i>u</i>, a round, shining body, connected by a nerve with the medio-cephalic ganglion, its nature unknown.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While the supraœsophageal ganglion,
or “brain,” of the insect is much more
complex than any other ganglion, consisting more exclusively both of sensory as well as motor ganglia and
their nerves, it should be borne in mind that the subœsophageal
ganglion also receives nerves of special sense, situated on the palpi
and on the tongue, as in the bee
and other insects; hence this
ganglion is probably complex,
consisting of sensory and motor
cells. The third thoracic ganglion
is also, without doubt, a
complex one, as in the locusts
the auditory nerves pass into it
from the ears, which are situated
at the base of the abdomen, while
in the green grasshoppers, such
as the katydids and their allies,
whose ears are situated in their
fore legs, the first thoracic ganglion
is a complex one. In the
cockroach and in Leptis (Chrysopila),
a common fly, the caudal
appendages bear what are probably
olfactory organs, and as
these parts are undoubtedly supplied from the last abdominal ganglion,
this is probably composed of sensory and motor ganglia; so
that we have in the ganglionated cord of insects a series of brains, as
it were, running from head to tail, and thus in a still stronger sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>than in vertebrates the entire nervous system, and not the brain
alone, is the organ of the mind of insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The simplest, most primitive form of the nervous system of insects
is seen in that of the Thysanura. That of Campodea has not yet
been fully examined, but in that of the more complicated genus,
Machilis (Fig. 239), we see that there is a pair of ganglia to nearly
each segment, while the brain (Fig. 241) is composed of three lobes,
viz. the optic, the cerebral (Fig. 239, <i>g</i>), behind which is the antennal
lobe, from which the antennal nerve takes its origin. Behind the
opening for the throat (<i>oe</i>) is situated the first ganglion of the
ventral cord, the subœsophageal ganglion, which gives rise to
the nerves supplying the jaws and other mouth-parts.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Collembola, which are retrograde Thysanura, there are from
one (Smynthurus), to three or four ventral ganglia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the winged insects, where the ganglia are more or less fused,
the fusion taking place in the head and at the end of the abdomen;
there are in the more simple and generalized forms, such as Ephemera,
the grasshopper, locusts (Fig. 240), etc., thirteen ganglia besides the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>ganglia, and usually from five to eight pairs of ganglia in the
abdomen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In certain winged insects the process of fusion or degeneration
is carried to such an extreme that there are either no abdominal
ganglia (Fig. 242, <i>D</i>), or their vestiges are situated in the thorax
and partially fused with the thoracic ones, as in the May beetle, in
which the prothoracic pair of ganglia is separate, while the two
other thoracic ganglia are fused with the abdominal, the latter being
situated in the thorax; this fusion is carried to a further extent
than in any other Coleoptera yet examined. In many Diptera and
Hemiptera the abdominal ganglia are either absent or the vestiges
are fused with the thoracic ganglia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rhizotrogus, which is allied to our May beetle, as also Hydrometra
and the Stylopidæ are said to lack the subœsophageal ganglion
(Brandt).</p>

<p class='c007'>In numerous Coleoptera (Acilius, Gyrinus, Necrophorus, Melolontha,
Bostrichus, Rhynchænus); in many Diptera (Culex, Tipula,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Asilus, Xylophaga, and Phora); and in the higher Hymenoptera
(Crabronidæ, Vespidæ, and Apidæ), as well as in many Lepidoptera
(Vanessa, Argynnis, and Pontia), two of the thoracic ganglia are
fused together, while all three are partially fused into a single mass
in many brachycerous Diptera (Conops, Syrphus, Pangonia, and the
Muscidæ); in certain Hemiptera (Pentatoma, Nepa, and Acanthia);
also in a beetle (<i>Serica brunnea</i>). Sometimes the subœsophageal
ganglion is fused with the first thoracic, as in Acanthia, Nepa, and
Notonecta. The greatest amount of variation is seen in the number
of abdominal ganglia, all being fused into a single one or from one
to eight. The fusion is usually greatest where the abdomen is shortened,
due to the partial atrophy and modification of the terminal
segments which bear the ovipositor, where present, and the genital
armature.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is only one pair of abdominal ganglia in Gyrinus and in certain
flies (Conops, Trypeta, Ortalis, and Phora); two in Rhynchænus,
a weevil, and in the flies, Syrphus and Volucella; three in Crabro
and Eucera; four in Sargus, Stratiomys and in butterflies, five in
the beetle, Silpha, and in the fly, Sciara, and the moth, Hepialus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nervous system in the larvæ of the metabolous orders is not
concentrated, though in that of the neuropterous Myrmeleo it has
undergone fusion from adaptation to the short compressed form of
this insect.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The brain</h4>

<p class='c016'>The brain of insects appears to be nearly, if not quite, as complex
as that of the lower vertebrates. As in the latter, the pair of supraœsophageal
ganglia, or brain, is the principal seat of the senses, the
chief organ of the insect’s mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is composed of a larger number of pairs of primitive ganglia
than any of the succeeding nerve-centres, and is, structurally, entirely
different from and far more complicated than the other ganglia of
the nervous system. It possesses a central body in each hemisphere,
a “mushroom body,” optic lobes and optic ganglia and olfactory lobe,
with their connecting and commissural nerve-fibres, and a number
of other parts not found in the other ganglia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the succeeding ganglia the lobes are in general motor; the
fibres composing the œsophageal commissures, and which arise from
the œsophageal commissural lobes, extend not only to the subœsophageal
ganglion, but pass along through the succeeding ganglia
to the last pair of abdominal nerve-centres.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Since, then, there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>direct continuity in the fibres forming the two main longitudinal
commissures of the nervous cord, and which originate in the brain,
it seems to follow that the movements of the body are in large part
directed or coördinated by the brain.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Still, however, a second
brain, so to speak, is found in the third thoracic ganglion of the
locust, which receives the auditory nerves from the ears situated in
the base of the abdomen; or in the first thoracic ganglion of the
green grasshoppers (katydids, etc.), whose ears are situated in their
fore legs; while even the last pair of abdominal ganglia in the cockroach
and mole cricket, is, so to speak, a secondary brain, since it
distributes sensory nerves to the caudal stylets, which are provided
with organs probably olfactory in nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to understand the morphology of the brain unless
we examine the mode of origin of the nervous system in the early
life of the embryo. The head of an embryo insect consists of six
segments, <i>i.e.</i> the ocular, antennal, premandibular, mandibular, and
the 1st and 2d maxillary segments, so named from the appendages
they bear. Of these the first three in the larva and adult are
preoral, and the last three are postoral. The antennal segment
was probably either postoral in the progenitors of insects, or the
antennæ were inserted on the side of the mouth, the latter finally
moving back.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The nervous system in the early embryonic condition, as shown
by Wheeler (Fig. 245), at first consists of nineteen pairs of primitive
ganglia, called <i>neuromeres</i>. Those of the head, which later in embryonic
life fuse together to form the brain, are the first three,
corresponding to the <i>protocerebrum</i>, <i>deutocerebrum</i>, and <i>tritocerebrum</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>of Viallanes. The first pair of primitive ganglia, and which is
situated in front of the mouth, is divided into three lobes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first or outermost lobe, according to Wheeler, forms the optic
ganglion of the larva and imago, while the second and third lobes.
(<i>pc<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>pc<sup>3</sup></i>) ultimately form the bulk of the brain proper, or the protocerebral
lobes. The second (primitively postoral) brain-segment
or pair of ganglia gives origin to the antennæ, while the third brain,
or premandibular (intercalary) segment, gives origin to a temporary
embryonic pair of appendages found in Anurida and Campodea (the
premandibular ganglia), and also to the nerves supplying the labrum.
These three pairs of ganglia later on in embryonic life become
preoral, the mouth moving backwards. The three pairs of primitive
ganglia, behind, <i>i.e.</i> the mandibular and 1st and 2d maxillary ganglia,
become fused together to form the subœsophageal ganglion,
and which in larval and adult life is postoral.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>If the tongue (ligula, or hypopharynx) represents a distinct pair

<p class='c007'>Viallanes first, independently of embryonic data, divided the
brain of adult insects into three regions or segments; <i>i.e.</i> the “<i>protocerebron</i>,”
“<i>deutocerebron</i>” and “<i>tritocerebron</i>,” which he afterwards

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Optic ganglia.</b>—Each of the two optic ganglia is formed of a
series of three ganglionic masses situated between the compound
eyes and the median procerebral mass, <i>i.e.</i> the ganglionic plate
(Fig. 249, <i>lg</i>), the external medullary mass (<i>me</i>), and the internal
medullary mass (<i>mi</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The postretinal fibres (<i>fpr</i>) arising from the facets or single eyes of
the compound eye (ommatidia) pass into the ganglionic plate (<i>lg</i>),
which is united within by the chiasmatic fibres (<i>che</i>, external chiasma)
of the external medullary mass (<i>me</i>). The last is attached to the
internal medullary mass (<i>mi</i>) by fibres (<i>chi</i>), some of which are chiasmatic,
and others direct. Finally, the internal medullary mass connects
with the median part of the protocerebrum by direct fibres
forming the optic nerve or tract (<i>to</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Procerebral lobes.</b>—The median procerebral lobes are fused together
on the median line, forming a single central mass. From each side

bridge (<i>plp</i>). The latter is a band uniting the two halves of the
brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The procerebral lobes also give origin to the nerves to the

<p class='c007'><b>The mushroom or stalked bodies.</b>—These remarkable organs were
first discovered by Dujardin, who compared them to mushrooms, and
observed that they were more highly developed in ants, wasps, and
bees than in the lower insects, and thus inferred that the higher
intelligence of these insects was in direct relation to the development
of these bodies. We will call them the <i>mushroom bodies</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two bodies consist of a rounded lobular mass (the trabecula)
of the procerebral lobe, from which arises a double stalk (Fig. 253),
the larger called the <i>cauliculus</i>, the smaller the <i>peduncle</i> (or pedicel);
these support the cap or <i>calyx</i>. The calices of the bee were compared
by Dujardin to a pair of disks on each side of the brain as
seen from above, “each disk being folded together and bent downwards
before and behind, its border being thickened, and the inner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>portion radiated.” In the locust there are but two divisions of the
calyx; in the cockroach, ants, wasps, and bees, four.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shape and relation of the mushroom bodies are represented
in Figs. 252 and 253. The bodies are connected by commissural
fibres, and are connected with the optic ganglion of the same side,
and with the central body; while they are connected with the
antennal lobes by the optico-olfactory chiasma.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The stalked bodies are
enveloped by the cortical
layers of ganglion-cells, those
filling the hollow of the calyx
having little or no protoplasm
around the nucleus.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Structure of the mushroom
bodies.</b>—By staining the brain
of the honey bee with bichromate
of silver, Kenyon has worked out
the structure of the mushroom
bodies, with their cells. The cup-shaped
bodies or calyces are
composed of fibrillar substance
(<i>punktsubstanz</i>). Each of these
cups, he says, is “filled to overflowing
with cells having large
nuclei and very little cytoplasm.”
From the under surface of each
of these cups there descends into
the general fibrillar substance of
the brain “a column of fibrillar
substance, which unites with its
fellow of the same side to send a
large branch obliquely downward
to the median line of the brain,
and an equally large or larger
branch straight forwards to the
anterior cerebral surface.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The cells of the mushroom
bodies, observes Kenyon, “stand
out in sharp contrast to all other
nerve cells known, though they
recall to some extent the cells of
Purkinje in the higher mammals.
Each of the cells contained within the fibrillar cup sends a nerve-process into the
latter, where it breaks up into a profusely arborescent system of branchlets,
which often appear with fine, short, lateral processes, such as are characteristic
of the dendrites of some mammalian nerve-cells.” Just before entering the
fibrillar substance, a fine branch is given off that travels along the inner surface
of the cup along with others of the same nature, forming a small bundle to the
stalk of the mushroom body, down which it continues until it reaches the origin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of the anterior and the inner roots above mentioned. “Here it branches, one
branch continuing straight on to the end of the anterior root, while the other
passes to the end of the inner root. Throughout its whole course the fibre and
its two branches are very fine. Nearly the whole stalk and nearly the whole
of each root is made up of these straight, parallel fibres coming from the cells
within the cup of the mushroom bodies. What other fibres there are enter
these bodies from the side, and branch between the straight fibres very much as
the dendrites of the cells of Purkinje branch among the parallel fine fibres from
the cells of the granular layer in the mammalian cerebellum. These fibres are
of the nature of association fibres.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Viallanes showed that from the olfactory or antennal lobes, as well as from
the optic ganglia, there are tracts of fibres which finally enter the cups of the
mushroom bodies, and Kenyon has confirmed this observation. Kenyon has
also, by the Golgi method, detected another tract, before unknown, “passing
down the hinder side of the brain, from the cups to the region above the œsophagus,
where it bends forward and comes in contact with fibres from the ventral
cord, which exists, although Binet was unable to discover any growth of fibres
connecting the cord with the brain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fibres entering the cups from the antennal lobe, the optic ganglia, and
the ventral region, spread out and branch among the arborescent endings of
the mushroom-body cells. The fibres branching among the parallel fibres of
the roots and the stalk lead off to lower parts of the brain, connecting with
efferent or motor-fibres, or with secondary association fibres, that in their turn
make such connections. This portion of the circuit has not been perfectly made
out, though there seems to be sufficient data to warrant the assumption just
made.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Such fibres existing as described, there is then a complete circuit for sensory
stimuli from the various parts of the body to the cells of the mushroom bodies.
The dendritic or arborescent branches of these cells take them up and pass them
on out along the parallel fibres or neurites in the roots of the mushroom bodies
as motor or other efferent impulses.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This, however, is not all. For there are numerous fibres evident in my
preparations, the full courses of which I have not been thus far able to determine,
but which are so situated as to warrant the inference that they may act as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>association fibres between the afferent fibres from the antennæ, optic ganglia,
and ventral system, and the efferent fibres. There is then a possibility of a
stimulus entering the brain and passing out as a motor impulse without going
into the circuit of the fibres of the mushroom bodies; or, in other words, a
possibility of what may be compared to reflex action in higher animals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mushroom bodies have not yet been found to be present in
the Synaptera, but occur in the larvæ, at least of those of most
metamorphic insects (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), though not
yet found in the larvæ of Diptera. The writer has found these bodies
in the nymphs of the locust (<i>Melanoplus spretus</i>), but not in the embryo
just before hatching. They occur in the third larval or nymph
stage of this insect. It is evident that by the end of the first larval
stage the brain attains the development seen in the third larval
state of the two-banded species (<i>C. bivittatus</i>).</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The result of our studies on the brain of the embryo locust was
that from the embryonic cerebral lobes are eventually developed
the central body and the two mushroom bodies. Fig. 254 shows
the early condition of the
mushroom bodies and their
undoubted origin from the
cerebral ganglia. Hence these
bodies appear to be differentiations
of the cerebral
ganglia or lobes, having no
connection with the optic or
antennal lobes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The central body</b> (Fig. 252,
<i>centr. b</i>).—This is the only
single or unpaired organ in
the brain. Dietl characterizes
it as a median commissural
system. Viallanes describes
it as formed entirely of a
very fine and close fibrillar
web, like a thick hemispherical skull-cap, situated on the median
line and united with the cerebral lobes. “It is like a central post
towards which converge fibres passing from all points of the brain;
being bound to the cerebral lobes, to the stalked bodies, to the optic
ganglia, and to the olfactory lobes by distinct fibrous bundles.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The antennal or olfactory lobes (Deutocerebrum).</b>—This portion of
the brain consists of two hemispherical lobes, highly differentiated
for special sensorial perceptions, and connected by a slightly differentiated
medullary mass, the dorsal lobe (Figs. 248, 249 <i>lo</i>), from
which arise the motor fibres and those of general sensibility. The
antennal lobes are in part attached to the optic ganglia, and partly
to the stalked body on the same side, by the optic olfactory chiasma
(Fig. 250 <i>fch</i>, <i>choo</i>), a system of fibres partially intercrossed on the
median line.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The œsophageal lobes (Tritocerebrum)</b> (Figs. 249, 250).—From this
region the labrum and viscera are innervated, the nerves to the latter
being called the visceral, sympathetic, or stomatogastric system. As
Viallanes remarks, though plainly situated in front of the mouth,
they are in fact post-œsophageal centres. The two lobes are situated
far apart, and are connected by a bundle of fibres passing
behind the œsophagus, called the transverse commissure of the
œsophageal ring (Lienard). The œsophageal ganglia, besides giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>rise to the labral nerves, also give origin to the root of the frontal
ganglion.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Histological elements of the brain</h4>

<p class='c016'>The brain and other ganglia are composed of two kinds of tissue.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The outer slightly darker, usually pale grayish white portion
consists of cortical or ganglion-cells differing in size. This portion
is stained red by carmine, the cells composing it readily taking the
stain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large ganglion cells (represented in Figs. 252 and 253) are
oval, and send off usually a single nerve-fibre; they have a thin fibrous
cell-wall, and the contents are finely granular. The nucleus is very
large, often one-half the diameter of the entire cell, and is composed
of large round refractive granules, usually concealing the nucleolus.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The medullary or inner part of the brain consists of matter
which remains white or unstained after the preparation has remained
thoroughly exposed to the action of the carmine. It consists of
minute granules and interlacing fibres. The latter often forms a
fine irregular network inclosing masses of finely granulated nerve
matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is called by Dietl “marksubstanz.” Leydig, in his Vom Bau des thierischen
Körpers, p. 89, thus refers to it:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the brain and ventral ganglia of the leech, of insects, and in the brain of
the gastropods (Schnecken) I observe that the stalks (stiele) of the ganglion-cells
in nowise immediately arise as nerve-fibres, but are planted in a molecular
mass or <i>punktsubstanz</i>, situated in the centre of the ganglion, and merged with
this substance. It follows, from what I have seen, that there is no doubt that
<i>the origin of the nerve-fibres first takes place from this central punktsubstanz</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This relation is the rule. But there also occur in the nerve-centres of the
invertebrates single, definitely situated ganglion-cells, whose continuations
become nerve-fibres without the intervention of a superadded <i>punktsubstanz</i>.”
We may, with Kenyon, call it the fibrillar substance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leydig subsequently (p. 91) further describes this fibrillar substance, stating
that the granules composing it form a reticulated mass of fibrillæ, or, in other
words, a tangled web of very fine fibres:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We at present consider that by the passage of the continuation of the
ganglion-cells into the <i>punktsubstanz</i> this continuation becomes lost in the fine
threads, and on the other side of the <i>punktsubstanz</i> the similar fibrillar substance
forms the origin of the axis-cylinders arranged parallel to one another; so it is
quite certain <i>that the single axis-cylinder derives its fibrillar substance as a
mixture from the most diverse ganglion-cells</i>.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The visceral (sympathetic or stomatogastric) system</h4>

<p class='c016'>This system in insects is composed (1) of a series of three unpaired
ganglia (Fig. 249, <i>gv<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>gv<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>gv<sup>3</sup></i>), situated over the dorso-median line of
the œsophagus, and connected by a median nervous cord or recurrent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>nerve (<i>nr</i>, <i>vagus</i> of Newport). The first of these ganglia is the
frontal ganglion, which is connected with the œsophageal ganglia by
a pair of roots (<i>rvt</i>), which have an origin primitively common with
that of the labral nerves (Fig. 248, <i>fg</i> and <i>lbr</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Of two pairs of lateral ganglia (Fig. 255, <i>ga</i>, <i>gp</i>) situated two on
each side of the œsophagus. They are connected both with the
antennal lobes by a nerve (<i>rvd</i>), and to the chain of unpaired ganglia
by a special connective. The first
pair of these ganglia sends nerves
to the heart and aorta; the second
pair to the tracheæ of the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unpaired median or recurrent
nerve (<i>nr</i>) extends back from
under the brain along the upper
side of the œsophagus, and (in
Blatta), behind the origin of the
nerves to the salivary glands,
enters an unpaired ganglion, called
the stomachic ganglion (<i>ganglion
ventriculare</i>), situated in front of
the proventriculus. The number
of these stomachic ganglia varies
in different orders of insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Blatta, Küpffer and also Hofer
have shown (Fig. 255) (Müller, Brandt,
<i>ex</i> Kolbe) that the nerve to each salivary
gland arises from three different
centres: the anterior end situated under
the œsophagus is innervated by the
paired visceral nerves from the hinder
paired ganglia; the remaining part by
nerves arising from each side of the
recurrent nerve; and thirdly by a pair
of nerves arising from the subœsophageal
ganglion which accompanies the common
salivary duct, and ends in branches which partly innervate the salivary
glands and in part their muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hofer considers that the function of this complex system of paired
and unpaired ganglia, with their nerves, is a double one, viz. serving
both as a centre for the peristaltic action of the œsophagus, and as
innervating the salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides these a second portion of the visceral system arises from
the thoracic and abdominal ventral cord. It may be seen in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>simplest condition yet known in the nervous system of Machilis
(Fig. 239 <i>s</i>). It consists of a fine, slender nerve, which extends
along the surface of the ventral chain of ganglia, and sending off a
pair of branches (accessory transverse nerves) in front of each
ganglion. These accessory nerves receive nerve-twigs from the
upper cord of the ventral chain, dilating near their origins into a
minute elongated ganglion, and then passing partly outwards to the
branches of the tracheæ and the muscles of the spiracles, uniting in
the middle line of each segment of the body behind the head, <i>i.e.</i> of
those segments containing a pair of ganglia.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>e.</i> The supraspinal cord</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the adult Lepidoptera has been detected, continuous with and
on the upper side of the abdominal portions of the ventral cord, a
longitudinal cord of connective tissue forming a white or yellowish
band, and which seems to be an outgrowth of the dorsal portion of
the neurilemma of the ventral cord. Muscles pass from it to the
neighboring ventral portions of the integument. Its use is unknown,
and attention was first called to it by Treviranus, who called it “an
unknown ventral vessel” (<i>Bauchgefäss</i>). Afterwards it was re-discovered
by Newport, who described it as “a distinct vascular canal.”
But Burger has proved by cross-sections that it is not tubular, but
a comparatively solid cord composed, however, of loose connective
tissue. Newport found it in the larva of <i>Sphinx ligustri</i>, but Cattie
states that it is not present in that of <i>Acherontia atropos</i>. It has
not yet been observed in insects of other orders, but its homologue
exists in the scorpion and in the centipede, and it may prove to
correspond with the far more complete arterial coat which, with the
exception of the brain, envelops the nervous system of Limulus.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>f.</i> Modifications of the brain in different orders of insects</h4>

<p class='c016'>There are different grades of cerebral development in insects, and
Viallanes claimed that it was no exaggeration to say that the brain
of the locust (Melanoplus) differs as much from that of the wasp
as that of the frog differs from that of man. He insists that the
physiological conditions which determine the anatomical modifications
of the brain are correlated with 1, the food; 2, the perfection
of the senses; and 3, with the perfection of the psychic
faculties. For example, in those which feed on solid food and
whose œsophagus is large (Orthoptera and Coleoptera), the connectives
are elongated, the subœsophageal commissure free in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>its extent, and the tritocerebrum is situated quite far from the preceding
segment of the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, in insects which feed on fluid food (Hymenoptera,
Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera), the œsophagus is slender
and the nervous centres which surround them are very much condensed;
the connectives are short, and the tritocerebrum is closely
fused, partly to a portion of the antennal lobes (deutocerebrum)
and partly to the mandibular ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the perfection of the senses, where, as in dragon-flies,
the eyes are very large, the optic ganglia are correspondingly so,
and in the same insects the antennæ being very small, the antennal
lobes are almost rudimentary. The ants exhibit inverse conditions;
in their brain the antennal lobes are well developed, while the optic
ganglia are reduced, and where, as in Typhlopone, the eyes are
wanting, they are completely atrophied.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In certain cave insects where the eyes are wanting, the optic
ganglia are also absent. In the eyeless cave species of Anophthalmus
the optic ganglia and nerves are entirely atrophied, as they are
in Adelops, which, however, has vestiges of the facets (ommatidia).
Fig. 257 represents the brain of <i>Chlænius pennsylvanicus</i>, a Carabid
beetle, with its eyes and optic ganglia (<i>op</i>) which may be compared
with Anopthalmus, in which these parts are totally atrophied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dujardin claimed that the degree of complication of the stalked
body of the Hymenoptera was in direct relation with their mental
powers. This has been proved by Forel, who has shown that in the
honey bee and ants the mushroom bodies are much more developed
in the workers than in the males or females and Viallanes adds
that these bodies are almost rudimentary in the dragon-flies, whose
eyes are so large; while on the contrary in the blind ants (Typhlopone),
these bodies are as perfect and voluminous as in the ants
with eyes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Within the limits of the same order the stalked bodies are most
perfect in the most intelligent forms. Thus in the Orthoptera, says
Viallanes, the Blattæ, Forficulæ, and the crickets, the mushroom
bodies are more perfect than in the locusts, which have simpler
herbivorous habits. This perfection of the mushroom bodies is seen
not only in the increase in size, but also in the complication of its
structures. Thus in the groups with lower instincts (Tabanus,
Æschna) the stalk does not end in a calyx projecting from the
surface of the brain, but its end, simply truncated, is indicated
externally only by an accumulation of the ganglionic nuclei which
cover it.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In types which Viallanes regards as more advanced, <i>i.e.</i> Œdipoda
and Melanoplus, the end of the stalk projects and is folded into a
calyx.</p>

<p class='c007'>The brain of the cockroach (Periplaneta, Fig. 258) is a step higher
than that of the locusts, each calyx being divided into two adjacent
calices, although the cockroaches are an older and more generalized
type than locusts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stalked bodies of cockroaches are thus complex, like those
of the higher Hymenoptera, the calices in Xylocopa, Bombus, and
Apis being double and so large as to cover almost the entire surface
of the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, in what Viallanes regards as the most perfect type (Vespa),
the sides of the calices are folded and become sinuous, so as to increase
the surface, thus assuming an appearance which, he claims, strongly
recalls that of the convolutions of the brain of the mammals.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cheshire also calls attention to a progression in the size of these appendages,
as well as in mental powers as we rise from the cockchafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>)
to the cricket, up to the ichneumon, then to the carpenter bee, and finally
to the social hive bee, “where the pedunculated bodies form the ⅕ part of the
volume of the cerebral mass, and the <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>870</span></span> of the volume of the entire creature,
while in the cockchafer they are less than <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>2300</span></span> the part. The size of the brain
is also a gauge of intelligence. In the worker bee the brain is <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>174</span></span> of the body;
in the red ant, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>296</span></span>; in the Melolontha, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>3500</span></span>; in the Dyticus beetle, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>4400</span></span>.”
(Bees and bee-keeping, p. 54.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>g.</i> Functions of the nerve-centres and nerves</h4>

<p class='c016'>As we have seen, the central seat of the functions of the nervous
system is not the brain alone (supraœsophageal ganglion), but each
ganglion is more or less the seat of vital movements, those of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>abdomen being each a distinct motor and respiratory centre. The
two halves of a ganglion are independent of each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Faivre, the brain is the seat of the will and of the
power of coördinating the movements of the body, while the
infraœsophageal ganglion is the seat of the motive power and also
of the will.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physiological experiments of Binet, which are in the line of
those of Faivre, but more thorough, demonstrate that an insect may
live for months without a brain, if the subœsophageal ganglion is
left intact, just as a vertebrate may exist without its cerebrum. As
Kenyon says: “Faivre long ago showed that the subœsophageal
ganglion is the seat of the power of coördination of the muscular
movements of the body. Binet has shown that the brain is the
seat of the power directing these movements. ‘A debrained hexapod
will eat when food is placed beneath its palpi, but it cannot go
to its food even though the latter be but a very small space removed
from its course or position. Whether the insect would be able to
do so if the mushroom bodies only were destroyed, and the antennal
lobes, optic lobes, and the rest of the brain were left intact, is a
question that yet remains to be answered’” (Kenyon).</p>

<p class='c007'>In insects which are beheaded, however readily they respond to
stimulation of the nerves, they are almost completely wanting in
will power. Yet insects which have been decapitated can still walk
and fly. Hymenoptera will live one or two days after decapitation,
beetles from one to three days, and moths (Agrotis) will show signs
of life five days after the loss of their head.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the loss of will power is gradual was proved by decapitating
<i>Polistes pallipes</i>. A day after the operation she was standing on her
legs and opening and closing her wings; 41 hours after the operation
she was still alive, moving her legs, and thrusting out her sting when
irritated. <i>Ichneumon otiosus</i>, after the removal of its head, remained
very lively, and cleaned its wings and legs, the power of coördination
in its wings and legs remaining. A horse-fly, a day after decapitation,
was lively and flew about in a natural manner.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When the abdomen is cut off, respiration in that region is not at
first interrupted. The seat of respiratory movements was referred
by Faivre to the hinder thoracic ganglion, but Plateau says that this
view must be entirely abandoned, remarking: “All carefully performed
experiments on the nervous system of Arthropoda have
shown that each ganglion of the ventral chain is a motor centre, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in insects a respiratory centre, for the somite to which it belongs”
(Miall and Denny’s The Cockroach, p. 164).</p>

<p class='c007'>The last pair of abdominal ganglia serve as the nervous centre
of the nerves sent to the genital organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recurrent or stomatogastric nerve, which, through the medium
of the frontal ganglion, regulates digestion, has only a slight degree
of sensibility; the insect remains quiet even when a powerful allurement
is presented to the digestive tract (Kolbe).</p>

<p class='c007'>Faivre states that the destruction of the frontal ganglion, or a
section of the commissures connecting it with the brain, puts an end
to swallowing movements; on the other hand, stimulation results
in energetic movements of this nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yersin, by cutting through the commissure in different places, and
thus isolating the ganglia of the nervous cord of <i>Gryllus campestris</i>,
arrived at the following results:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The section of a nerve near its origin rendered the organ supplied
by this nerve incapable of performing its functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. If the connectives between two ganglia, <i>i.e.</i> the second and third
thoracic ganglia, are cut through, the fore as well as hinder parts of
the body retain their power of motion and sensation; but a stimulus
applied to the anterior part of the body does not pass to the hinder
portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Insects with an incomplete metamorphosis after section of the
connectives are not in every case unable to moult and to farther
develop.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. If only one of the two connectives be cut through, the appendages
of the side cut through which take their origin between the
place injured and the hinder end of the body, often lose sensation
and freedom of motion, or the power of coördination of movements
becomes irregular. Sometimes this is shown by an unsteadiness in
the gait, so that the insect walks around in a circle; after a while
these irregularities cease, and the movements of the limbs on the
injured side are only slightly restrained. By a section of both connectives
in any one place the power of coördination of movements is
not injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The section of the connectives appear to have no influence on
nutrition, but affects reproduction, the attempt at fertilization on the
part of the male producing no result, and the impregnated female
laying no eggs.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Injury to the brain, or to the subœsophageal, or one of the
thoracic ganglia, is followed by a momentary enfeeblement of the
ganglion affected. Afterwards there results a convulsive trembling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>which either pervades the whole body or only the appendages
innervated by the injured ganglion.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. As a result of an injury to the brain there is such a lack of
steadiness in the movements that the insect walks or flies in a circle;
for instance, a fly or dragon-fly thus injured in flying describes a
circle or spiral. Steiner, in making this experiment, observed that
the insect circled on its uninjured side. The brain is thus a motor
centre.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. By injuring a thoracic ganglion, one or all the organs which
receive nerves from the ganglion are momentarily weakened. Afterwards
the functions become restored. Sometimes, however, the
insect walks in a circle. Faivre observed that after the destruction
of the metathoracic ganglion of <i>Dyticus marginalis</i> the hind wings
and hind legs were partially paralyzed (Kolbe, <i>ex</i> Yersin).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Of the eyes of insects there are two kinds, the simple and the
compound. Of the former there are usually three, arranged in a
triangle near the top of the head, between the
compound eyes (Fig. 259, <i>B</i>). The compound or
facetted eyes, which are usually round and prominent,
differ much in size and in the number of
facets.</p>

<p class='c013'>The number of facets varies from 12 in Lepisma,—though
in a Brazilian beetle (Lathridius) there are only
seven unequal facets,—to 50 in the ant, and up to 4000
in the house-fly, 12,000 in <i>Acherontia atropos</i>, 17,000 in
Papilio, 20,000 in the dragon-fly (Æschna), 25,000 in a
beetle (Mordella), while in <i>Sphinx convolvuli</i>, the number
reaches 27,000. The size of the facets seems to bear some
relation to that of the insect, but even in the smallest
species none have been observed less than <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>2000</span></span> of an inch
in diameter. Day-flying Lepidoptera have smaller facets
than moths (Lubbock).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The simple, or single-lensed eye (ocellus).</b>—Morphologically the
simple eye is a modified portion of the ectoderm, the pigment
enclosing the retinal cells arising from specialized hypodermal cells,
and covered by a specialized transparent portion of the cuticula,
forming the corneal lens. The apparatus is supplied with a nerve,
the fibres of which end in a rod or solid nerve-ending, as in other
sensory organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>As seen in the ocellus of Dyticus (Fig. 260), under the corneal
lens the hypodermis forms a sort of pit, and the cells are modified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>to form the vitreous body (vitrella) and retina. Each retinal cell
(<i>re</i>) is connected with a fibre from the optic nerve, contains pigment,
and ends in a rod directed outwards towards the lens. The cells at
the end of the pit or depression are, next to the lens, without pigment,
and, growing in between the retina and the lens, fill it up, and
thus form a sort of vitreous body.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ocellus appears to be a direct heirloom from the eyes of worms, while the
many-facetted compound eye of the crustaceans and of insects is peculiar to
these classes. The compound eye of the myriopod Scutigera differs structurally
in many respects from the compound eye of insects, and that of Limulus still
more so.</p>

<p class='c013'>It should be observed that in the young nymph of Ephemera, as well as in the
semipupa of Bombus, each of the three ocelli are situated on separate sclerites.
In Bombus the anterior ocellus has a double shape, being broad, transversely
ovate, and not round like the two others, as if resulting from the fusion of what
were originally two distinct ocelli.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ocelli are not infrequently wanting, as in adult Dermaptera, in the Locustidæ,
and in certain Hemiptera (Hydrocora). In Lepidoptera there are but two
ocelli; in geometrid moths they are often atrophied, and they are absent in
butterflies (except Pamphila).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The compound or facetted eye (ommateum).</b>—The facetted arthropod
eye is wonderfully complex and most delicately organized, being far
more so than that of vertebrates or molluscs. The simplest or most
primitive facetted eye appears to be that of Lepisma. As stated by
Watase, the compound eye of arthropods is morphologically “a
collection of ectodermic pits whose outer open ends face towards the
sources of light, and whose inner ends are connected with the central
nervous system by the optic nerve fibres.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The facetted eye is composed of numerous simple eyes called
<i>ommatidia</i>, each of which is complicated in structure. The elements
which make up an <i>ommatidium</i> are the following: (1) The
facet or cornea, which is a specialized portion of the cuticula; and
(2), the crystalline lens or cone; (3), the nerve-ending or <i>retinula</i>,
which is formed out of the retinula cells and the <i>rhabdom</i> or rod
lying in its axis; and (4) of the pigment enclosing the lens and rod;
the last three elements are derived from the hypodermis. The
single eyes are separated from each other by pigment cells.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The facet or cornea.</b>—This is biconvex, clear, transparent, usually
hexagonal in outline, and refracts the light. The corneal lenses are
cast in moulting.</p>

<p class='c013'>The corneal lenses are circular in most cases where they are very convex, as
in Lathridius and Batocera. The hexagonal ones are very irregular. When
they are very convex the eye has a granular appearance, but when not greater
than the convexity of the eye itself, the eye appears perfectly smooth (Bolbocerus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>etc.). The facets in the lower part of the eye of Dineutes are a trifle
larger than in the upper part (about nine to ten). In many insects the reverse
is the case, the upper facets being larger than the lower, a notable instance being
Anax. The intervening lines between the facets are often beset with hairs, sometimes
very long and dense, as in the drone bee and Trichophthalmus; and the
modifications of the hairs into scales which takes place on the body occurs on
the eyes also, the scales on the eyes of some beetles of the family Colydiidæ
being very large, arranged in lines over the eyes like tombstones (Trachypholis).<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The cones are of various shapes and sizes in insects of different
groups, or are entirely wanting, and Grenacher has divided the eyes
of insects into <i>eucone</i>, <i>pseudocone</i>, and <i>acone</i>. As the pseudocone

following division may be made:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Eucone eyes</i>, comprising those with a well-developed cone.

<p class='c007'><i>a.</i> Pseudocone eyes; in which, instead
of the crystalline lens or cone, there
are four cells filled with a transparent
fluid medium, and a smaller protoplasmic
portion containing a nucleus (Muscidæ,
Fig. 264, <i>pc</i>). Hickson states that the
difference between the eucone and pseudocone
eyes lies in the fact that in the
pseudocone eye “the refracting body
formed by the cone-cell lies behind the
nuclei,” and in the eucone eye in front
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Acone eyes</i>, where the cone or refracting
body is wanting, but is represented
by the four primitive cone-cells.
Acone eyes occur in Forficulidæ,
Hemiptera (except Cicadidæ), the nematocerous
Diptera (Tipula, etc.), and
those Coleoptera which have less than
five tarsal joints.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span><b>The retinula and rod.</b>—The retinula is morphologically a nerve-end
cell, situated at the end of a nerve-fibril arising from the optic
nerve. The elements of the retinula of Musca are six in number
and surround the <i>rhabdom</i> (Fig. 264), which consists of a bundle of
six long, delicate chitinous rods, more or less firmly united together
(Fig. 264, <i>R</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The six elements of the retinula of Musca are in their outer or
distal portion free from one another, but towards their base are
fused into a sheath (Fig. 264, <i>r</i>). They are true nerve-end cells, as
shown by Müller and by Max Schultze, their views having been confirmed
by Grenacher and by Hickson. The relations of the nerves
to the rods after passing through the basal membrane is seen in
Fig. 266.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The pigment.</b>—The cones or pseudocones are mostly buried in
pigment, as well as the rods; and the pigment forms two layers.
The outer of the two layers is called the iris pigment (Fig. 265, <i>e</i>,
<i>iris tapetum</i>), and the inner (<i>f</i>) the retinal pigment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the ommatidia internally there occur, according to Hickson,
pigment cells (Fig. 264, <i>p.g<sub>3</sub></i>), each of which stands on the basilar
membrane and sends a fine process outwards towards the internal
process of the external pigment-cell (<i>p.g<sub>2</sub></i>). A long, slender tracheal
vesicle also passes in between the retinulæ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The basilar membrane.</b>—This is a thin fenestrate
membrane (Fig. 261) separating the cones and
rods from the optic tract (Fig. 264, <i>b.m</i>). It is
perforated for the passage of tracheal diverticula
and of the optic nerve fibrils. It separates the
dioptric or instrumental portion of the eye from
the percipient portion, <i>i.e.</i> the optic tract.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The optic tract.</b>—This is the optic ganglion of
earlier writers, and appears to be the percipient
portion of the eye, as opposed to the dioptric
portion. If the reader will examine Figs. 249
and 261, he will see that it consists of three
distinct ganglionic swellings, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>opticon</i>, <i>epiopticon</i>,
and <i>periopticon</i>, whose structure is very
complicated. In Musca (Fig. 261) the first ganglionic
swelling (opticon) is separated from the
brain by a slight constriction, which Berger regards
as the homologue of the optic nerve of the other
arthropods. It consists of a very fine granular
matrix traversed throughout by a fine meshwork
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of minute fibrillæ, the neurospongium of Hickson. In the young
cockroach (Periplaneta) the optic nerve separating the cerebral
ganglion from the opticon is much longer in proportion than it is in
the adult blow-fly.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second ganglionic swelling (epiopticon, Fig. 261, <i>c.op</i>) is
separated from the opticon by a tract of fine nerve-fibrils, which
partially decussate; at the decussation two or three larger nerve-cells
may be seen. It also contains a few scattered nerve-cells (<i>n.c</i>).
The third ganglionic swelling (periopticon,
<i>p.op</i>) is separated from the
others by a bundle of long optic
nerve-fibrils, which cross one another.
It is composed of a number of cylindrical
masses of neurospongium
arranged side by side (Fig. 261,
<i>p.op</i>). Between these elements of
the periopticon, which do not seem
to bear any relation to the number
of ommatidia, a single nerve-cell is
very frequently seen. The periopticon
does not occur in Periplaneta and
Nepa (Hickson). The three optic
ganglia thus described, together with
the cerebral ganglia, are surrounded
by a sheath of densely packed nerve-cells.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bearing in mind the fact that the retinulæ
are the nerve-end cells of the fibres
passing through the periopticon, it will be
well to read the following account, by Hickson,
of the terminal anastomosis of the
optic fibrils in the periopticon of <i>Agrion
bifurcatum</i>, and to examine his sketch
(Fig. 266):</p>

<p class='c013'>“The terminal anastomosis of Agrion may be conveniently divided into four
regions. First the region (1) lying nearest to the periopticon in which the
nerve-cells are numerous, and the fibrils leaving the periopticon form a complicated
plexus; the region (2) next to this, in which the fibrils have collected into
bundles separated by spaces occupied by very thin-walled tracheæ in which
there are no spiral markings, and lymph-spaces; next, the region (3) in which
the fibrils form a final plexus, and in which there are again a considerable number
of nerve-cells; and, lastly, the region (4) in which the fibrils are again collected
into bundles, separated by spaces containing tracheæ, which perforate the
basement membrane to supply the retinulæ.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It would seem as if the decussation of the optic nerve-fibrils were a matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>primary importance, as it so generally occurs, but in the young of that most
generalized of all pterygote insects, the cockroach (Periplaneta), Hickson states
that the optic nerve-fibrils which leave the periopticon pass without decussating
to the ommateum, and in the adult there is only a partial decussation. In
Nepa there is no decussation, but the anastomosis is complicated by the presence
of looped and transverse anastomoses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking at the eye as a whole, Hickson regards all the nerve
structure of the eye lying between the crystalline cone-layer and the
true optic nerve to be analogous with the retina of other animals.
With Ciaccio, Berger, and others, he does not regard the layer composed
of the retinulæ and rhabdoms as the equivalent of the retina
of vertebrates, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Origin of the facetted eye.</b>—The two kinds of eye, the simple and
the compound, are supposed to have been derived from a primitive
type, resembling the single eye (ommatidium) of the acone eye of
Tipula. As stated by Lang, “an increase of the elements of this
primitive eye led to the formation of the ocellus; an increase in
number of the primitive eyes, and their approximation, led to the
formation of the compound facet eye.” This view is suggested, he
says, by the groups of closely contiguous single eyes of the myriopods,
considered in connection with the compound eye of Scutigera.
Grenacher looks upon simple (ocelli) and compound eyes as “sisters,”
not derived from one another, but from a common parentage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Immature insects rarely possess compound eyes; they are only known to
occur in the nymphs of Odonata and Ephemeridæ, and in the larvæ and pupa of
Corethra.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Mode of vision by single eyes or ocelli.</b>—In their simplest condition,
the eyes of worms and other of the lower invertebrates, probably
only enable those animals to distinguish light from darkness.
The ocelli of spiders and of many insects, however, probably enable
them, as Lubbock remarks, to see as our eyes do. The simple lens
throws on the retina an image, which is perceived by the fine terminations
of the optic nerve. The ocelli of different arthropods
differ, however, very much in degree of complexity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Müller considered that the power of vision of ocelli “is probably
confined to the perception of very near objects.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This may be inferred,” Müller states, “partly from their existing principally
in larvæ and apterous insects, and partly from several observations which
I have made relative to the position of these simple eyes. In the genus Empusa
the head is so prolonged over the middle inferior eye that, in the locomotion of
the animal, the nearest objects can only come within the range. In <i>Locusta
cornuta</i>, also, the same eye lies beneath the prolongation of the head.... In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the Orthoptera generally, also, the simple eyes are, in consequence of the depressed
position of the head, directed downwards towards the surface upon
which the insects are moving.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Lowne considers that in the ocellus of Eristalis,
the great convexity of the lens must give it a very short focus, and the
comparatively small number of rods render the picture of even very near objects
quite imperfect and practically useless for purposes of vision, and that the function
of the ocelli is “the perception of the intensity and the direction of light,
rather than of vision, in the ordinary acceptation of the term.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Réaumur, Marcel de Serres, Dugès, and Forel have shown by experiment,
that in insects which possess both ocelli and compound eyes, the former may be
covered over without materially affecting the movements of the animals, while if
the facetted eyes are covered, they act as if in the dark (Lubbock).</p>

<p class='c013'>While Plateau regards the ocelli as of scarcely any use to the insect, and
Forel claims that wasps, humble bees, ants, etc., walk or fly almost equally well
without as with the aid of their ocelli, Lubbock demurs to this view, and says
the same experiments of Forel’s might almost be quoted to prove the same with
reference to the compound eyes. Indeed, the writer has observed that in caves,
eyeless beetles apparently run about as freely and with as much purpose, as their
eyed relatives in the open air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Plateau has recently shown that caterpillars which have ocelli alone are very
short-sighted, not seeing objects at a distance beyond one or two centimetres,
and it has been fully proved by Plateau and others, that spiders, with their well-formed
ocelli, are myopic, and have little power of making out distinctly the
shape of the objects they see.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the whole, we are rather inclined to agree with Lubbock and Forel, that
the ocelli are useful in dark places and for near vision. They are, as Lubbock
states, especially developed in insects, such as ants, bees, and wasps, which live
partly in the open light and partly in the dark recesses of nests. Moreover, the
night-flying moths nearly all possess ocelli, while with one known exception
(Pamphila) they are wanting in butterflies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally, remarks Lubbock, “Whatever the special function of ocelli may be,
it seems clear that they must see in the same manner as our eyes do—that is to
say, the image must be reversed. On the other hand, in the case of compound
eyes, it seems probable that the vision is direct, and the difficulty of accounting
for the existence in the same animal of two such different kinds of eyes is certainly
enhanced by the fact that, as it would seem, the image given by the
medial eyes is reversed, while that of the lateral ones is direct” (p. 181).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Mode of vision by facetted eyes.</b>—The complexity of the facetted
eyes of insects is amazing, and difficult to account for unless we
accept the mosaic theory of Müller, who maintained that the distinctness
of the image formed by such an eye will be greater in
proportion to the number of separate cones. His famous theory is
thus stated: “An image formed by several thousand separate points,
of which each corresponds to a distinct field of vision in the external
world, will resemble a piece of mosaic work, and a better idea cannot
be conceived of the image of external objects which will be depicted
on the retina of beings endowed with such organs of vision, than by
comparing it with perfect work of that kind.”</p>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 267.</span>—From Lubbock.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>How vision is effected by a many-facetted eye is thus explained
by Lubbock: “Let a number of transparent tubes, or cones with
opaque walls, be ranged side by side in front of the retina, and
separated from one another by black pigment. In this case the only
light which can reach the optic nerve will be that which falls on any
given tube in the direction of
its axis.” For instance, in Fig.
267, the light from <i>a</i> will pass
to <i>a′</i>, that from <i>b</i> to <i>b′</i>, that from
<i>c</i> to <i>c′</i>, and so on. The light from
<i>c</i>, which falls on the other tubes,
will not reach the nerve, but will
impinge on the sides and be absorbed
by the pigment. Thus,
though the light from <i>c</i> will
illuminate the whole surface of the eye, it will only affect the nerve
at <i>c′</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to this view those rays of light only which pass directly
through the crystalline cones, or are reflected from their sides, can
reach the corresponding nerve-fibres. The others fall on, and are
absorbed by, the pigment which separates the different facets.
Hence each cone receives light only from a very small portion of the
field of vision, and the rays so received are collected into one spot of
light.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows from this theory that the larger and more convex the
eye, the wider will be its field of vision, while the smaller and
more numerous are the facets, the more distinct will be the vision
(Lubbock).</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory is certainly supported by the shape and size and the
immense number of facets of the eye of the dragon-fly, which all
concede to see better, and at a longer range, than probably any other
insect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Müller’s mosaic theory was generally received, until doubted and criticised by
Gottsche (1852), Dor (1861), Plateau, and others. As Lubbock in his excellent
summary states, Gottsche’s observation (previously made by Leeuwenhoek)
that each separate cornea gives a separate and distinct image, was made on the
eye of the blow-fly, which does not possess a true crystalline cone. Plateau’s
objection loses its force, since he seems to have had in his mind, as Lubbock
states, Gottsche’s, rather than Müller’s, theory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Müller’s theory is supported by Boll, Grenacher, Lubbock, Watase, and
especially by Exner, who has given much attention to the subject of the vision
of insects, and is the weightiest authority on the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gottsche’s view that each of the facetted eyes makes a distinct image which
partially overlaps and is combined with all the images made by the other facets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>was shown by Grenacher to be untenable, after repeating Gottsche’s experiments
with the eyes of moths, in which the crystalline cones are firm and attached to
the cornea. He was thus able to remove the soft parts, and to look through the
cones and the cornea. When the microscope was focussed at the inner end of
the cone, a spot of light was visible, but no image. As the object-glass was
moved forward, the image gradually came into view, and then disappeared
again. Here, then, the image is formed in the interior of the cone itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Exner attempted to make this experiment with the eye of Hydrophilus, but
in that insect the crystalline cones always came away from the cornea. “He,
however, calculated the focal length, refraction, etc., of the cornea, and concluded
that, even if, in spite of the crystalline cone, an image could be formed,
it would fall much behind the retinula.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In these cases, then,” adds Lubbock, “an image is out of the question.
Moreover, as the cone tapers to a point, there would, in fact, be no room for an
image, which must be received on an appropriate surface. In many insect eyes,
indeed, as in those of the cockchafer, the crystalline cone is drawn out into a
thread, which expands again before reaching the retinula. Such an arrangement
seems fatal to any idea of an image.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lubbock thus sums up the reasons which seem to favor Müller’s theory of
mosaic vision, and to oppose Gottsche’s view: “(1) In certain cases, as in
Hyperia, there are no lenses, and consequently there can be no image; (2) the
image would generally be destroyed by the crystalline cone; (3) in some cases
it would seem that the image would be formed completely behind the eye, while
in others, again, it would be too near the cornea; (4) a pointed retina seems
incompatible with a clear image; (5) any true projection of an image would in
certain species be precluded by the presence of impenetrable pigment, which
only leaves a minute central passage for the light-rays; (6) even the clearest
image would be useless, from the absence of a suitable receptive surface, since
both the small number and mode of combination of the elements composing that
surface seem to preclude it from receiving more than a single impression; (7) no
system of accommodation has yet been discovered; finally (8), a combination
of many thousand relatively complete eyes seems quite useless and incomprehensible.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In his most recent work (1890) on the eyes of crustacea and insects, Exner
states that the numerous simple eyes which make up the compound eye have
each a cornea, but it is more or less flat, and the crystalline part of the eye has
not the shape of a lens, but of a “lens cylinder,” that is, of a cylinder which is
composed of sheets of transparent tissue, the refracting powers of which decrease
toward the periphery of the cylinder. If an eye of this kind is removed and
freed of the pigment which surrounds it, objects may be looked at through it
from behind; but its field of vision is very small, and the direct images received
from each separate eye are either produced close to one another on the retina
(or rather the retinulæ of all the eyes) or superposed. In this last case no less
than thirty separate images may be superposed, which is supposed to be of great
use to night-flying insects. Exner claims that many other advantages result
from the compound nature of an insect’s eye. Thus the mobile pigment, which
corresponds to our iris, can take different positions, either between the separate
eyes or behind the lens cylinders, in which case it acts as so many screens to
intercept the over-abundance of light. Exner finds that with its compound eyes
the common glow-worm (Lampyris) is capable of distinguishing large signboard
letters at a distance of ten or more feet, as well as extremely fine lines engraved
one-hundredth of an inch apart, if they are at a distance of less than half an
inch from the eye. Exner substantiates the truth of the results of Plateau’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>experiments, and claims that while the compound eye is inferior to the vertebrate
eye for making out the forms of objects, it is superior to the latter in distinguishing
the smallest movements of objects in the total field of vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>More recently Mallock has given some optical reasons to show that Müller’s
view is the true one. He concludes, and thus agrees with Plateau, that insects
do not see well, at any rate as regards their power of defining distant objects,
and their behavior certainly favors this view. It might be asked, What advantage,
then, have insects with compound eyes over those with simple eyes?
Mallock answers, that the advantage over simple-eyed animals lies in the fact
that there is hardly any practical limit to the nearness of the objects they can
examine. “With the composite eye, indeed, the closer the object the better the
sight, for the greater will be the number of lenses employed to produce the impression;
whereas, in the simple eye the focal length of the lens limits the distance
at which a distinct view can be obtained.” He gives a table containing
measures of the diameters and angles between the axes of the lenses of various
insect eyes, and states that the best of the eyes would give a picture about as
good as if executed in rather coarse woodwork and viewed at a distance of a
foot, “and although a distant landscape could only be indifferently represented
on such a coarse-grained structure, it would do very well for things near enough
to occupy a considerable part of the field of view.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The principal use of the facetted eye to perceive the movements of
animals.</b>—Plateau adopts Exner’s views as to the use of the facetted
eye in perceiving the movements of other animals. He therefore
concludes that insects and other arthropods with compound eyes do
not distinguish the form of objects; but with Exner he believes that
their vision consists mainly in the perception of moving bodies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Most animals seem but little impressed by the form of their enemies or of their
victims, though their attention is immediately excited by the slightest displacement.
Hunters, fishermen, and entomologists have made in confirmation of this
view numerous and demonstrative observations.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though the production of an image in the facetted eye of the insect seems
impossible, we can easily conceive, says Plateau, how it can ascertain the existence
of a movement. Indeed, if a luminous object is placed before a compound
eye, it will illuminate a whole group of simple eyes or facets; moreover, the centre
of this group will be clearer than the rest. Every movement of the luminous
body will displace the centre of clearness; some of the facets not illuminated
will first receive the light, and others will reënter into the shade; some nervous
terminations will be excited anew, while those which were so formerly will cease
to be. Hence the facetted eyes are not complete visual organs, but mainly organs
of orientation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Plateau experimented in the following way: In a darkened room, with two
differently shaped but nearly equal light-openings, one square and open, the
other subdivided into a number of small holes, and therefore of more difficult
egress, he observed the choices of opening made by insects flying from the other
end of the room. Careful practical provisions were made to eliminate error;
the light-intensity of the two openings was as far as possible equalized or else
noted, and no trees or other external objects were in view. The room was not
darkened beyond the limit at which ordinary type ceases to be readable, otherwise
the insects refused to fly (it is well known that during the passage of a thick
cloud insects usually cease to fly). These observations were made on insects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>both with or without ocelli, in addition to the compound eyes, and with the
same results.</p>

<p class='c013'>From repeated experiments on flies, bees, etc., butterflies and moths, dragon-flies
and beetles, Plateau concludes that insects with compound eyes do not notice
differences in form of openings in a half-darkened room, but fly with equal readiness
to the apparently easy and apparently difficult way of escape; that they are
attracted to the more intensely lighted opening, or to one with apparently
greater surface; hence he concludes that they cannot distinguish the form of
objects, at least only to a very slight extent, though they readily perceive objects
in motion.</p>

<p class='c013'>One result of his experiments is that insects only utilize their eyes to choose
between a <i>white</i> luminous orifice in a dark chamber, or another orifice, or group
of orifices, <i>equally white</i>. They are guided neither by odorous emanations nor
by differences of color. He thinks that bees have as bad sight and act almost
exactly as flies.</p>

<p class='c013'>From numerous experiments on Odonata, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera,
and Hymenoptera Plateau arrives provisionally at the following conclusions:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. Diurnal insects have need of a quick strong light, and cannot direct their
movements in partial obscurity.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. Insects with compound eyes do not notice differences of form existing between
two light orifices, and are deceived by an excess of luminous intensity as
well as by the apparent excess of surface. In short, they do not distinguish the
form of objects, or if they do, distinguish them very badly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lubbock, however, does not fully accept Plateau’s experiments with the windows,
and thinks they discern the form of bodies better than Plateau supposes.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>How far can insects see?</b>—It is now supposed that no insects can perceive
objects at a greater distance than about six feet. On an average Lepidoptera
can see the movements of rather large bodies 1.50 meters, but Hymenoptera only
58 cm., and Diptera 68 cm.; while the firefly (Lampyris) can see tolerably well
the form of large objects at a distance of over two meters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Until further experiments are made, it seems probable, then, that few if any
insects have acute sight, that they see objects best when moving, and on the
whole—except dragon-flies and other predaceous, swiftly flying insects, such as
certain flies, wasps, and bees, which have very large rounded eyes—insects are
guided mainly rather by the sense of smell than of sight.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Relation of sight to the color of eyes.</b>—It appears from the observations of
Girschner that those Diptera with eyes of a uniform color see better than those
with brightly banded or spotted eyes. Thus those flies (Asilidæ, Empidæ, Leptidæ,
Dolichopidæ) whose predaceous habits requires good or quick sight have
uniformly dark eyes, as have also such flies as live constantly on the wing,
<i>i.e.</i>, the holoptic Bombyliidæ, Syrphidæ, Pipunculidæ, etc., whose eyes are also
very large.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those flies whose larvæ are parasitic on other animals have eyes of a uniform
color that they may readily detect the most suitable host for their young; such
are the Bombyliidæ, Conopidæ, Pipunculidæ, and Tachinidæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certain flies which live in the clear sunlight, as many Dolichopidæ, some
Bombyliidæ, and certain Tabanidæ (Tabanus, Chrysops, Hæmatopota), and
which are often easily caught with the hand, have eyes spotted or banded with
bright or metallic colors. This is also a sexual trait, as the males of some horse-flies
visiting flowers have eyes of a single color, the spots and bands surviving
only on the lower and hinder parts of the eye, while their voracious blood-sucking
females have the entire eye spotted or banded (Kolbe).</p>

<p class='c013'><b>The color-sense of insects.</b>—Insects, as Spengel first suggested, appear to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>able to distinguish the color of objects. Lubbock has experimentally proved
that bees, wasps, and ants have this power, blue being the favorite color of the
honey-bee, and violet of ants, which are sensitive to ultra-violet rays.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is well known that butterflies will descend from a position high in the air,
mistaking white bits of paper for white flowers; while, as we have observed,
white butterflies (Pieris) prefer white flowers, and yellow butterflies (Colias)
appear to alight on yellow flowers in preference to white ones.</p>

<p class='c013'>The late Mr. S. L. Elliott once informed us that on a red barn with white
trimmings he observed that white moths (Spilosoma, Hyphantria, and <i>Acronycta
oblinita</i>) rested on the white parts, while on the darker, reddish portions sat
Catocalæ and other dark or reddish moths. Gross observed that house-flies
would frequent a bluish green ring on the ceiling of his chamber; but if it were
covered by white paper, the flies would leave the spot, though they would return
as soon as the paper ring was removed (Kolbe). We have observed that house-flies
prefer green paper to the yellowish wall of a kitchen, but were not attracted
to sheets of a Prussian blue paper, attached to the same wall and ceiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is generally supposed that the shape and high colors of flowers attract insects;
but Plateau has made a number of ingenious experiments which tend to
disprove this view. He used in his investigations the dahlia, with its central
head of flowerets, which contrast so strongly with the corolla. He finds (1) that
insects frequent flowers which have not undergone any mutilation, but whose
form and colors are hidden by green leaves. (2) Neither the shape nor lively
colors of the central head (capitulum) seem to attract them. (3) The gayly
colored peripheral flowerets of simple dahlias and, consequently, of the heads of
other composite flowers, do not play the rôle of signals, such as has been attributed
to them. (4) The insects are evidently guided by another sense than that
of sight, and this sense is probably that of smell.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b</i>. The organs of smell</h4>

<p class='c016'>The seat of the organs of smell is mainly in the antennæ, and they
may be regarded as the principal olfactory organs. For our present
knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the olfactory organs
of insects we are mainly indebted to the recent investigations of
Hauser and of Kraepelin. The following historical and critical
remarks are translated from Kraepelin’s able treatise:</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Historical sketch of our knowledge of the organs of smell.</b>—In the first half
of the last century began the inquiries as to the seat of the sense of smell in the
arthropods. Thus Réaumur, in his Mémoires (i, p. 283; ii, 224), expressed
the view that in the antennæ was situated a special organ which might be an
organ of smell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lesser, Roesel, Lyonet, Bonnet, and others expressed the same opinion.
Before this Sulzer suggested that an “unknown sense” might exist in the
antennæ; others regarded the stigmata as organs of smell, as these were considered
the natural passages for the olfactory currents. Duméril, in two special
treatises as well as in his Considérations générales, sought to prove the theory
as to the seat of the organs of smell in the stigmata.</p>

<p class='c013'>Against both of these leading views as to the seat of the sense of smell were
expressed, in the last century, different opinions. Thus Comparetti thought
that the sense of smell might be localized in very different points of the head,
in the antennal club of lamellicorns, in the sucking-tube of Lepidoptera, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>special frontal holes of flies and Orthoptera, etc., while Bonsdorf considered the
palpi as organs of smell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus four different views, confused, were held at the opening of this century;
the Hamburg zoölogist, M. C. S. Lehrman, in three different treatises, brought
together all the hitherto known observations and arguments, treated them critically,
and completed them by his own extended studies. Lehrman adopted the
opinions of Reimarus, Baster, Duméril, and Schelver, that the stigmata presented
the most convenient place for the site of the organs of smell. Cuvier followed
throughout the lead of Lehrman, but Latreille returned to the view of the perception
of smell by the antennæ, while Treviranus considered the mouth of
arthropods as the probable site of the sense of smell, an opinion which, before
his time, Huber, in his experiments on bees, had thought to be correct. Marcel
de Serres (1811) returned again to the palpi, and asserted—at least in the
Orthoptera—their functions to be olfactory, while Blainville, ten years later,
again expressed anew the old opinion that the antennæ, or at least their terminations,
were organs of smell. Up to that date there was an uncertainty as to the
seat of the organs both of smell and hearing. Fabricius, indeed, had already,
in 1783, thought he had found an organ of hearing at the base of the outer
antenna. In 1826 J. Müller mentioned an already well-known organ in the
abdomen of crickets as an organ of hearing. Müller, however, was doubtful,
from the fact that the nerve passing to this organ arose, not from the brain, but
from the third thoracic ganglion; but, notwithstanding, he remarks: “Perhaps
we have not found the organ of hearing in insects because we sought for it in
the head.” This discovery was afterwards considerably broadened and extended
by Siebold’s work, for the views of these naturalists on the seat of both
organs had a definite influence, especially in Germany. For awhile, indeed,
Müller’s hypothesis stood in complete contradiction, so that during the following
decennial was presented anew the picture of opposing observations and opinions
as to the nature of the organs of smell. While Robineau-Desvoidy, at the end
of the twentieth year, and also later, in different writings, strove energetically
for the olfactory nature of the antennæ, Straus-Dürckheim held fast to the view
that the tracheæ possessed the function under discussion. At the same period
Kirby and Spence, in their valuable Introduction to Entomology, maintained
that “two white cushions on the under side of the upper lip” in the mouth of
biting insects formed a nose or “rhinarium” peculiar to insects. This opinion
was afterwards adopted by Lacordaire (Introduction à Entomologie), and also
by Oken in his Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie, while Burmeister, rejecting all
the views previously held, believed that insects might perhaps smell “with the
inner upper surface of the skin.” Müller’s locust’s ear he regarded as a vocal
organ.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides these occasional expressions of opinion, the French literature of the
thirtieth and fortieth years of this century recorded a long series of special
works, with weighty experimental and physiological contents, on this subject.
Thus Lefebre, in 1838, described the experiments which he made on bees, and
which seemed to assign the seat of the sense of smell to the antennæ. Dugès
reported similar researches on the Scolopendræ, and Pierret thought that the
great development of the antennæ in the male Bombycidæ might be similarly
interpreted. Driesch sought to give currency to the views of Bonsdorf, Lamarck,
and Marcel de Serres, that the sense of smell was localized in the palpi, though
Duponchel went back to the old assertion of æroscepsis of Lehrman, <i>i.e.</i> of the
air-test through the antennæ, and Goureau again referred the seat of the sense
of smell to the mouth. In England, Newport at this period put forth a work in
which he considered the antennæ as organs of touch and hearing, and the palpi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>as organs of smell—a view which, as regards the antennæ, was opposed by
Newman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the contention as to the use of the antennæ and the seat of the organs
of smell and hearing fluctuated from one side to the other, and when in 1844
Küster, by reason of his experiments on numerous insects, again claimed that
“the antennæ are the smelling organs of insects,” he argued on a scientific
basis; yet v. Siebold and Stannius (1848), in their valuable Lehrbuch der
vergleichenden Anatomie (p. 581), remarked that “organs of smell have not yet
with certainty been discovered in these animals.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The following decennial was of marked importance in the judgment of many
disputed questions. Almost contemporaneously with Siebold and Stannius’
Lehrbuch appeared an opportune treatise by Erichson, in which this naturalist
first brought forward certain anatomical data as to the structure of the antennæ
of insects. In a great number of insects Erichson described on the upper surface
of the antennæ peculiar minute pits, “pori,” which, according to him,
were covered by a thin membrane, and to which he ascribed the perception of
smell. A still more thorough work on this subject was published in the following
year by Burmeister, who recognized in the pits of lamellicorns many small
tubercles and hairs; and about the same time Slater, as also Pierret and Erichson
before him had done, out of the differences of the antennal development in
the males and females in flesh and plant-eating insects, brought together the
proof of the olfactory function of the antennæ. But the most valuable work of
this period is that of Perris, who, after a review of previous opinions, by exact
observations and experiments, a model of their kind, sought to discover the
seat of the sense of smell. He comes to the conclusion that the antennæ, and
perhaps also the palpi, may claim this sense, and finds full confirmation of
Dufour’s views, and adopts as new the physiological possibility expressed by
Hill and Bonnet, that the antennæ might be the seat of both senses—those of
smell and hearing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The beautiful works of Erichson, Burmeister, and Perris could not remain
long unnoticed. In 1857 Hicks published complete researches on the peculiar
nerve-endings which he had found in the antennæ, also in the halteres of flies
and the wings of all the other groups of insects, and which he judged to be for
the perception of smell. But Erichson’s and Burmeister’s “pori” were by
Lespès, in 1858, explained to be so many auditory vesicles with otoliths. This
view was refuted by Claparède and Claus without their deciding on any definite
sense. Leydig first made a decided step in advance. In different writings this
naturalist had busied himself with the integumental structures of arthropods,
and declared Erichson’s view as to the olfactory nature of the antennal pits as
the truest, before he, in his careful work on the olfactory and auditory organs of
crabs and insects, had given excellent representations of the numerous anatomical
details which he had selected from his extensive researches in all groups of
arthropods. Besides the pits which were found to exist in Crustacea, Scolopendræ,
beetles, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Orthoptera, Neuroptera, and Hemiptera,
and which had only thus far been regarded as sense-organs, Leydig first
calls attention to the widely distributed pegs and teeth, also considering them as
sense-organs. “Olfactory teeth,” occurring as pale rods, perforated at the end,
on the surface of the antennæ of Crustacea, Myriopoda, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera,
Coleoptera, are easily distinguished, and besides the “olfactory pegs” of
the palpi, may be claimed as organs of smell. The nerve-end apparatus first
discovered by Hicks in the halteres and wings, Leydig thinks should be ranked
as organs of hearing.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was still some opposition to Leydig’s opinion that in the insects the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>sense of smell is localized in the antennæ (teeth and pits), and here the work of
Hensen might be mentioned, which in 1860 had a decided influence upon the
conclusion of some inquiries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus Landois denied that the antennæ had the sense of smell, and declared
that the pits in the antennæ of the stag beetle were auditory organs. So, also,
Paasch rejected Leydig’s conclusion, while he sought to again reinstate the old
opinion of Rosenthal as to the olfactory nature of the frontal cavity of the
Diptera. In spite of the exact observations and interesting anatomical discoveries
of Forel in ants, made in 1874, there appeared the great work of Wolff
on the olfactory organs of bees, in which this observer, with much skill and
acuteness, sought to give a basis for the hypothesis of Kirby and Spence that the
seat of the sense of smell lay in the soft palatine skin of the labrum within
the mouth (<i>i.e.</i> the epipharynx). Joseph, two years later, drew attention to the
stigmata as olfactory organs, referring to the olfactory girdle, and Forel sought
by an occasional criticism of Wolff’s conclusions to prove experimentally the
olfactory function of the antenna; but Graber, in his widely read book on insects,
defended the Wolffian “nose” in the most determined way, and denied
to the antennæ their so often indicated faculty of smell. In 1879 Berté thought
he had observed in the antenna of the flea a distinct auditory organ, and Lubbock
considered the organs of Forel in the antennæ of ants as a “microscopic
stethoscope.” In 1879 Graber described a new otocyst-like sense-organ in the
antennæ of flies, which was accompanied by a complete list of all the conceivable
forms of auditory organs in arthropods. In this work Graber described in
Musca and other Diptera closed otocysts with otoliths and auditory hairs, as
Lespès had previously done. But Paul Mayer, in two essays, refuted this view
in a criticism of the opinion of Berté, referring the “otocysts with otoliths” to
the well-known antennal pits into which tracheæ might pass. Mayer did not
decide on the function of the hairs which extend to the bottom of the pits;
while in the most recent research, that of Hauser, the author again energetically
contended for the olfactory function of the antennæ. Both through physiological
experiments and detailed anatomical investigations Hauser sought to
prove his hypothesis, as Pierrot, Erichson, Slater, and others had done before
him, besides working from an evolutional point of view. In a purely anatomical
aspect, especially prominent are his discovery of the singularly formed nerve-rods
in the pits and peg-like teeth of the Hymenoptera and their development,
as well as the assertion that numerous hairs in the pits described by Leydig,
Meyer, etc., should be considered as direct terminations of nervous fibres passing
into the pits. In the pits he farther, with Erichson, notices a serous fluid,
which may serve as a medium for the perception of smells. Among the latest
articles on this subject are those of Künckel and Gazagnaire, which are entirely
anatomical, while the latest treatise of Graber on the organs of hearing in insects
opposes Hicks’s theory of the olfactory function of the nerve-end apparatus in
the halteres, wings, etc., and argues for the auditory nature of these structures.
Finally, according to Voges, the sense of smell is not localized, but spread over
the whole body.</p>

<p class='c013'>My own observations on different groups of insects agree, in general, with
those of Perris, Forel, and Hauser, without being in a position to confirm or
deny the varying relations of the Hemiptera. That irritating odorous substances
(chloroform, acetic acid) cause the limbs to move in sympathy with the stimulus,
I have seen several times in Acanthosoma; still it may be a gustatory rather
than olfactory stimulus.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turning now from speculation and simple observation to exact anatomical and
histological data, the nerve-end apparatus seems to have a distinct reference to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the perception of odors. It comprises a structure composed of nervous substances
which are enclosed in a chitinous tube, and either only stand in relation
to the surrounding bodies by the perforated point, or pass to the surface as free
nerve-fibrillæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>In insects there is a remarkable and fundamental difference in the structures
of the parts supposed to be the organs of smell. Erichson was acquainted only
with the “pori” covered by a thin membrane; but Burmeister, in his careful
work on the antennæ of the lamellicorns, distinguished pits at the bottom of
which hairs rise from a cup-like tubercle, from those which were free from
hairs. Leydig afterwards was the first to regard as olfactory organs the so-called
pegs (<i>kegel</i>), a short, thick, hair-like structure distinctly perforated at the
tip, which had already, by Lespès in Cercopis, etc., been described as a kind of
tactile papilla. Other very peculiar olfactory organs of different form, Forel
(Fourmis de la Suisse) discovered in the antennæ of ants, which Lubbock incorrectly
associated with the nerve-end apparatus found by Hicks in other insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the final result of his researches Kraepelin states that the
great variety of antennal structures previously described may be referred
to a single common fundamental type of a more or less developed
free or sunken hair-like body which stands in connection by
means of a wide pore-canal with a many-nucleated ganglion-cell.
The latter sends only a relatively slender nerve-fibre (axial cord)
through the pore-canal into the hair; but the same is enclosed by
epithelial cells which surround the pore-canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hauser’s researches on the organs of smell in insects were so
carefully made and conclusive that our readers will, we feel sure, be
glad to have laid before them in detail the facts which prove so
satisfactorily that the antennæ of most insects are olfactory rather
than auditory in their functions.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Physiological experiments.</b>—First of all one should observe as
exactly as possible the normal animal in its relation to certain odorous
substances, whose fumes possess no corrosive power or peculiarities
interfering with respiration; then remove the antennæ and try
after several days to ascertain what changes have taken place in the
relation of the animal to the substance. In order to come to no false
results it is often necessary to let the insects operated upon rest one
or two days, for immediately after the operation they are generally
so restless that a careful experiment is impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extirpation of the antennæ is borne by different insects in
different ways; many bear it very easily, and can live for months
after the operation, while others die in the course of a few days
after the loss of these appendages. The animals seem to be least
injured if the operation is performed at a time when they are hibernating.
<i>Pyrrhocoris apterus</i>, and many other insects, afforded a very
striking proof of this relation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Experiments made by placing the antennæ in liquid paraffine so
as to cover them with a layer of paraffine, thus excluding the air,
gave the same result as if the antennæ had been removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experiments may be divided, according to their object, into
three groups. Experiments of the first kind were made on insects
in their relation to strong-smelling substances, as turpentine, carbolic
acid, etc., before and after extirpation of the antennæ. The second
group embraces experiments on the relation of animals as regards
their search for food; and finally the third group embraces experiments
on the relation of the sexes relative to reproduction before
and after the extirpation of the antennæ.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Relation of insects to smelling substances before and after the loss of
their antennæ.</b>—Taking a glass rod dipped in carbolic acid and holding
it within 10 cm. of <i>Philonthus œneus</i>, found under stones at the
end of February, it was seen to raise its head, turn it in different
directions, and to make lively movements with its antennæ. But
scarcely had Hauser placed the rod close to it when it started back
as if frightened, made a sudden turn, and rushed, extremely disturbed,
in the opposite direction. When he removed the glass rod,
the creature busied itself for some time with its antennæ, while it
drew them, with the aid of its fore limbs, through its mouth,
although they had not come into direct contact with the carbolic
acid. There was the same reaction against oil of turpentine, and it
was still more violent against acetic acid.</p>

<p class='c007'>After having many times carefully tested the relations of the
normal animal to the substances mentioned, the antennæ were removed
from the socket-cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the second day after Hauser experimented with the insects,
they exhibited no reaction either against the carbolic acid, the oil of
turpentine, or even against the acetic acid, although he held the glass
rod which had been dipped into it for one or two minutes before and
over the head. The creatures remained completely quiet and immovable,
at the most slightly moving the palpi. They showed
otherwise no change in their mode of life and their demeanor; they
ate with great eagerness flesh which had been placed before them,
or dead insects, and some were as active as usual as late as May.
These beetles had, as proved by the experiments, lost the sense of
smell alone; how far the sense of touch was lost Hauser could not
experimentally decide.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same results followed experiments with species of the genus
Ptinus, Tenebrio, Ichneumon, Formica, Vespa, Tenthredo, Saturnia,
Vanessa, and Smerinthus; also many species of Diptera and Orthoptera,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>besides Julus and Lithobius, while many larvæ reacted in the
same manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Less satisfactory were the experiments with Carabus, Melolontha, and Silpha;
there is no doubt that the species of these genera, through the extirpation of
their antennæ, become more or less injured as to the acuteness of their powers
of smelling; but they never show themselves wholly unable to perceive strong-smelling
substances.</p>

<p class='c013'>The allurement of the substance acts for a longer time on those deprived of
their antennæ, then they become restless, then they wander away from the glass
tube held before them; still all their movements are but slightly energetic, and
the entire reaction is indeterminate and enfeebled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Experiments with the Hemiptera gave still more unfavorable results; after
the loss of their antennæ they reacted to smells as eagerly as those did which
were uninjured.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Experiments on the use of the antennæ in seeking for food.</b>—Under
this head experiments were made with Silpha, Sarcophaga, Calliphora,
and Cynomyia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Silpha and its larva were treated in the following manner: they
were placed in large boxes whose bottoms were covered with moss,
etc.; in a corner of the box was placed a bottle with a small opening,
in which was placed strong-smelling meat. So long as the beetles
were in possession of their antennæ they invariably after a while
discovered the meat exposed in the bottle, while after the loss of
their antennæ they did not come in contact with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a similar way acted the species of Sarcophaga, Calliphora, and
Cynomyia. Hauser, in experimenting with these, placed a dish with
a large piece of decayed flesh on his writing-table. In a short time
specimens of the flies referred to entered through the open window
of the room. The oftener he drove them away from the meat would
they swarm thickly upon it. Then closing the window and catching
all the flies, he deprived them of their antennæ and again set them
free. They flew about the room, but none settled upon the flesh nor
tried to approach it. Where a fly had alighted on a curtain or other
object, the decayed flesh was placed under it so that the full force of
the effluvium should pass over it, but even then no fly would settle
upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Experiments testing the influence of the antennæ of the males in
seeking the females.</b>—For this purpose Hauser chose those kinds in
which the male antennæ differ in secondary sexual characters from
those of the female, and in which it is known that they readily
couple in confinement, as <i>Saturnia pavonia</i>, <i>Ocneria dispar</i>, and
<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>. The two first-named insects did not couple
after the extirpation of their antennæ. Of <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>twenty pairs were placed in a moderately sized box. On the next
morning twelve pairs of them were found coupling. Hauser then,
after removing the first lot, placed a new set of thirty pairs in the
same box, cut off all the antennæ of the males and those of a number
of females. On the following morning only four pairs were found
coupling, and at the end of three days five others were observed
sexually united.</p>

<p class='c013'>From these experiments Hauser inferred that those insects deprived of their
antennæ were placed in the most favorable situation, such as they would not
find in freedom; for the space in which the insects moved about was so limited
that the males and females must of necessity meet. But at the same time the
results of the experiments cannot absolutely be regarded as proving that the
males, after the loss of their antennæ, were then not in condition to find
the females, because in the case of the above-mentioned moths, under similar
conditions, after the extirpation of the antennæ no sexual union took place. If,
however, the experiments made do not all lead to the results desired, Hauser
thinks that the results agree with those of his histological researches, that in the
greater number of insects the sense of smell has its seat in the antennæ. His
results also agree with those of Perris.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Structure of the organs of smell in insects.</b>—The olfactory organs
consist, in insects,—<i>i.e.</i>, all Orthoptera, Termitidæ, Psocidæ, Diptera,
and Hymenoptera, also in most Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, and
Coleoptera,—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Of a thick nerve arising from the brain, which passes into the
antennæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Of a sensitive apparatus at the end, which consists of staff-like
cells, which are modified hypodermis cells, with which the fibres of
the nerves connect.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Of a supporting and accessory apparatus, consisting of pits, or
peg- or tooth-like projections filled with a serous fluid, and which
may be regarded as invaginations and outgrowths of the epidermis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hauser adds a remark on the distribution of the pits and teeth in
the larvæ of insects, saying that his observations are incomplete,
but that it appears that in the larvæ the teeth are most generally
distributed, and that they occur not on the antennæ alone, but on
the palpi; but in very many larvæ neither pits nor teeth<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> occurred.
In the Myriopoda teeth-like projections occur on the ends of the
antennæ. In Lithobius they form very small, almost cylindrical,
pale organs.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the course of a special description of these sense-organs in the
Orthoptera, Hauser describes at length those of <i>Œdipoda cœrulescens</i>
and <i>Caloptenus italicus</i>. On one antennal joint of Caloptenus (Fig.
268) was often counted 50 pits; on the anterior joints the number
diminishes to about 30. Hauser
thinks that in all Orthoptera whose
antennæ are like those of Caloptenus
occur similar pits, as he found them
in Stenobothrus (Fig. 269) as well as in
Œdipoda. Gryllotalpa possesses similar
pits,—four to six on each antennal
joint, making between 300 and 400
pits on each antenna.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> In <i>Mantis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>religiosa</i> the pits were not detected, but on each joint, except the
eighth basal, there are about 200 small, hollow, curved teeth with a
fine opening in front.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Neuroptera (Chrysopa) there occur on the antennæ, besides
numerous very long tactile bristles, small pale, transparent teeth.
No pits could be detected.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Hemiptera (two species of Pyrrhocoris only were examined)
only two kinds of tactile bristles occurred, but Hauser detected no
pits, though Lespès states that they are present.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of the Diptera, Hauser examined more than 60 species. The
pits in the <i>Diptera brachycera</i> (Muscidæ, etc.) are unexceptionally
confined to the third antennal joint. Their number varies extraordinarily
in the different species. <i>Helophilus florens</i> has on each
antennal disk only a single pit, while
<i>Echinomyia grossa</i> possesses 200 of them.
In flies of certain families the pits are
compound, and contain 10, 20, and often
100 olfactory hairs, partly arising from
the coalescence of several pits. Such pits
are usually divided by lateral walls into
several chambers, whose connection is only
indicated by their common outlet. Simple
olfactory pits with a single olfactory style
were observed only in the Tabanidæ,
Asilidæ, Bombylidæ, Leptidæ, Dolichopidæ,
Stratiomyidæ, and Tipulidæ. In the last
the compound forms do not occur at all,
but in the other families mentioned also
occur compound pits, receiving from two
to ten nerve-terminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The antennal pits of flies are always sac-like invaginations of the
external chitinous integument, of manifold shapes, opening externally
and never closed by a membrane. The pits differ but slightly
in the different species, and that of <i>Cyrtoneura stabulans</i> (Fig. 273)
is described at length as typical of those of brachycerous flies in
general.</p>

<p class='c007'>The olfactory pits of the Tipulidæ seem to have a somewhat
different structure, since the external passage is closed. It is circular,
surrounded with a slight chitinous wall, and not covered
with bristles. Such pits in their external appearance are like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>those of the locust (Caloptenus) and many Hymenoptera. They
are situated usually on the third antennal joint. <i>Pachyrhina pratensis</i>
L. has about 60 of them, as have <i>Tipula oleracea</i> L. and
Ctenophora.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Lepidoptera, olfactory pits are much like those of flies.
Hauser describes in detail those of <i>Vanessa io</i>. Those of the moths
were not examined, but they can be readily and satisfactorily proved to be the site of
the olfactory sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Historical researches in respect to the Coleoptera generally gave a
very unfavorable result, contrary to Lespès’s views. That author
states that in the Carabidæ the pits are found on the four first
joints, but Hauser could discover them in none which he examined.
Usually only tactile bristles occur, so also in the Cerambycidæ, Curculionidæ,
Chrysomelidæ, and Cantharidæ. In a blind silphid beetle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>(<i>Adelops hirtus</i>) of Mammoth Cave we have found well-marked
olfactory organs (Fig. 274). Similar organs occur in the antennæ of
the Panorpidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>Olfactory pits, however, without doubt occur in Silpha, Necrophorus,
Staphylinus, Philonthus, and Tenebrio. The openings of the
pits are small and surrounded with a small chitinous ring; in Silpha,
Necrophorus, and Tenebrio they cannot easily be distinguished from
the insertion-cavities of the bristles, but in Philonthus and Staphylinus
they are less like them, being distinguished by their somewhat
larger size and their often more oval form. In <i>Philonthus æneus</i>
about 100 such small pits occur irregularly on the terminal joints;
besides, in this species on each side of the terminal joint is an
apparatus which is like the compound pit generally occurring in
the Diptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very remarkable pits occur in the antennal lamellæ of <i>Melolontha
vulgaris</i> (Fig. 275) and other lamellicorns. On the outer surface of
the first and seventh (in the female the sixth) antennal leaf, as also
on the edges of the other leaves, only arise scattered bristles; on
the inner surface of the first and seventh leaves, as also on both surfaces
of the second to sixth leaves, are close rows of rather shallow
depressions of irregular form, some circular, others regularly hexagonal.
Their number is enormous: in the males 39,000, in the
females about 35,000, occur on each antenna.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The antennal pits and teeth of <i>Dyticus marginalis</i> are morphologically
and physiologically identical with those of bees and wasps. In
<i>Anophthalmus bilimekii</i>, Hauser found on the last antennal joints
about 60 teeth, which essentially differ in form from those previously
described; they are very pale, transparent, cylindrical, elongated,
and bent elbow-shaped on the first third, so that the last two-thirds
run parallel with the antenna. The length of these remarkable
teeth is 0.035 mm.,
their breadth 0.005 mm.
He only found them in
Anophthalmus, and in no
other species of Carabidæ;
they must resemble the
teeth described in Chrysopa.
Our species possesses
similar processes
(Fig. 277). Similar teeth
occur on the maxillary
and labial palpi of beetles. <i>Dyticus marginalis</i> possesses at the end
of each terminal palpal joint a group of very small teeth, which were
also detected in <i>Anophthalmus bilimekii</i>, <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, etc. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span><i>Carabus violascens</i> were detected on the maxillary palpi large, plainly
microscopical, white disks, which are surrounded with a great number
of extremely small teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether the above-described organs on the palpi of beetles should
be considered as olfactory or gustatory in their nature can only be
determined by means of physiological experiments; they probably
receive taste-nerve terminations.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Hymenoptera furnished very good material for histological
purposes, so that Hauser could not only study the terminal apparatus
of the olfactory nerves in the perfect
insect, but also in three different
stages of the pupa. These are
described at length, as regards the
distribution of the pits and teeth, in
<i>Vespa crabro</i>; each joint of the
antenna (flagellum) possesses between
1300 and 1400 pits, nearly
60 teeth, and about 70 tactile hairs;
on the terminal joint there are more
than 200 teeth, so that each antenna
has between 13,000 and 14,000 olfactory
pits and about 700 teeth
(Kegeln). Fig. 278 represents a
cross-section through the penultimate
antennal joint of <i>Vespa
crabro</i>; we can see how thick are
the series of openings on the surface
of the antennæ, and how
regular is the distribution of the
teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distribution of the olfactory
pits and olfactory teeth is thus
seen to be very general; the deviations are so insignificant that there
is no reason for the establishment of more than one type.</p>

<p class='c007'>Antennal pits with a small crevice-like opening occur in genera
nearly allied to Vespa and also in most Ichneumonidæ, Braconidæ,
and Cynipidæ. But the crevice-like openings in these families are
considerably longer and often are of a somewhat twisted shape. In
all the species with translucent antennæ we can recognize the inner
mouth of the pit as a round or nearly round disk situated usually
under the middle of the opening. The antennal pits of <i>Apis mellifica</i>,
as well as those of Bombus (Fig. 280) and allied genera, differ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>from those of the Ichneumonidæ in being not like crevices, but
circular openings.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The distribution of the olfactory peg or tooth-like projections
seems to be much more limited than that of the pits in the Ichneumonidæ.
Hauser could not find any.
<i>Apis mellifica</i> possesses on each antennal
joint only about twenty slender pale teeth, scarcely a third as many
as in <i>Vespa crabro</i>; on the other hand, Formica, of which genus
several species were examined, seems to have far more teeth than
pits; they are relatively long, pale, transparent, and somewhat
clavate; they are not unlike those of Chrysopa; on the terminal
joint only occur the round openings (<i>Fvo</i>), which lead into a bottle-shaped
invagination of the integument (<i>Fv</i>) and contain an olfactory
style (Fig. 281). In the Tenthredinidæ only teeth and no pits were to
be detected. Sirex has on the under side of the nine last joints of each
antenna a group of from 200 to 300 small teeth, which resemble
those of <i>Vespa crabro</i>; Lyda has on the terminal joints about 100
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>teeth. We may add that supposed organs of smell occur on the
antennæ of Campodea (Fig. 282).</p>

<p class='c007'>Kraepelin also thus briefly summarizes Hauser’s statements as to
the forms of the different organs of smell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The manifold nature of the antennal organs has, by Hauser, from thorough
studies of the nerve-elements belonging to them, been not simplified but rendered
more complicated. According to this naturalist we may distinguish the
following forms which the olfactory organs may assume: 1. “Pale, tooth-like
chitinous hairs on the outer surface of the antennæ, which are perforated at the
end; nothing is known as to the relation of the nerve passing into it (Chrysopa,
Anophthalmus). 2. In pit-like depressions of the antennæ arise <i>nerve-rods</i>
(without a chitinous case) which stand in direct relation with a ganglion-cell
lying under it. These pits are either <i>simple</i>, viz. with only an ‘olfactory rod’
(Tabanus, Fig. 283, and other Diptera, Vanessa), or <i>compound</i> (Muscidæ, and
most other Diptera, and Philonthus). It is important that these pits are partly
<i>open</i> (in the above-named groups of insects), and partly <i>closed</i> and covered with a
thin membrane, under whose concavity the olfactory rods end (Orthoptera,
Melolontha, and other lamellicorns). 3. Short, thick pits sunken slightly into the
surface of the antennæ, and over this a chitinous peg perforated at the end, in
whose base, from the interior, projects a very singular nerve-peg, which is situated
over an olfactory ganglion-cell, and provided with a slender crown of little rods,
and flanked on each side by a flagellum-cell (Hymenoptera). 4. Round or crevice-like
pits covered over by a perforated chitinous membrane with nerve-rods like
those in 3, but in place of the flagellum-cell with ‘membrane-forming’ cells
spread before it. Hauser finally mentions further differences in the ganglion-cells
sent out into the nerve-end apparatus. These exhibit in Diptera and Melolontha
only one nucleus, in Hymenoptera a single very large one (with many nucleoli)
and three small ones, in Vanessa six, in Orthoptera a very large number of
nuclei, etc.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c</i>. The organs of taste</h4>

<p class='c016'>The gustatory organs of insects are microscopic pits or setae,
either hair-like or resembling short pegs, which form the ends of
ganglionated nerves. They are difficult to distinguish morphologically
from certain olfactory structures, and it is owing to their
position at or very near the mouth that they are supposed to be
gustatory in nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meinert was the first (1860) to suggest that organs of taste
occurred in ants. He observed in the maxillæ, and tongue of these
insects a series of canals in the cuticula of these organs connected
with ganglion-cells, and through them with the nerves, and queried
whether they were not organs of taste. Forel afterwards (1874)
confirmed these observations. Wolff in an elaborate work (1875)
described a group of minute pits (Fig. 284) at the base of the tongue
of the honey bee, which he supposed to possess the sense of smell,
but Forel and also Lubbock attributed to these sensory pits the
function of taste. Ten years afterward Will showed conclusively,
both by anatomical studies and by experiments, that Diptera and
Hymenoptera possess gustatory organs. He, however, denied that
the organs of Wolff were gustatory, and maintained that organs of
smell were confined to the maxillæ, paraglossæ, and tongue. As we
shall see, however, what appear to be with little doubt taste-pits,
with hairs or pegs arising from them, are most numerous on the
epipharynx of nearly all insects, and situated at a point where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>necessarily must come in contact with the food as it enters the
mouth and passes down the throat.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Kraepelin (1883) discovered taste-organs on the proboscis of the
fly, and taste-hairs at the end of the tongue of the humble-bee
(Fig. 285), and afterwards Lubbock critically discussed the subject,
and concluded that the organs of taste in insects are situated “either
in the mouth itself, or on the organs immediately surrounding it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Structure of the taste-organs.</b>—The organs have been best studied
by Will, who, besides describing and figuring the chitinous structures,
such as the pits or cups, hairs and the pegs, showed that they
were the terminations of ganglionated nerves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Figure 286 represents the taste-cups on the maxilla of a wasp, and
Fig. 287 the taste-cone or peg projecting from the cup or pit. The
cell out of which the pit and projecting hair or peg are formed is a
modified hypodermis cell; and the seta is apparently a modification
of a tactile hair, situated at the end of a nerve, which just beneath
the chitinous structures passes into a ganglion-cell, which sends off a
nerve-fibre to the main nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>Will detected on the tongue of the yellow ant (<i>Lasius flavus</i>) from
20 to 24, and in Atta from 40 to 52, of these structures. The number
of pits on the maxillæ vary much, not always being the same on
the two sides of the same insect. We have observed these taste-cups
in the honey and humble bee, not only at the base of the second
maxillæ (Fig. 288, <i>g</i>), but also on the paraglossæ (<i>pg</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Distribution in other orders of insects.</b>—The writer has detected these
taste-cups in other orders than Diptera and Hymenoptera. They very generally
occur in mandibulate insects on the more exposed surface of the epipharynx
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>(compare pp. 43–46). We have not observed them in the Synaptera (Lepisma
and Machilis).</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Dermaptera the taste-cups appear to be undeveloped in the nymph,
while in the adult they are fewer in number than in any other pterygote order
yet investigated.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a species of Forficula from Cordova, Mexico, the taste-pits are few in
number, there being only about a dozen on each side in all; most of them
being situated on the anterior half, and a few near the base. The taste-pits are
provided each with a short fine seta, as usual arising from the centre.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the Odonata, however, they are fairly well developed; in Calopteryx,
about 50 taste-cups were discovered; in a species of Diplax about 28, there
being a group of 14 at the base of the epipharynx on each side of the median
line, while in <i>Æschna heros</i> there are two groups of from 25 to 30 taste-cups,
situated as in the two aforenamed genera.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Orthoptera the gustatory cups are numerous, well developed, and present
in all the families except the Phasmidæ, where, however, they may yet be
found to occur.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>In a large cockroach (Blabera) from Cuba they are well developed. On each
side of the middle of the epipharynx is a curved row of stiff, defensive spines,
and at the distal end of each row is a sensory field, containing 20 taste-cups on
one side and 23 on the other. Near the front edge of the clypeal region are
two more sensory fields, situated on each side of the median line, there being
35 taste-cups in each field. The taste-cups in this form are rather smaller than
usual in the order.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Acrydiidæ they are more numerous than in the Blattidæ. For example,
in <i>Camnula pellucida</i>, near what corresponds to the front edge of the
clypeus are two gustatory fields, each bearing about 35 taste-pits. Just in
front, under the clypeo-labral suture, are two similar fields, each containing
from 40 to 42 taste-pits. There are none in front of these. There are thus
about 140–150 sense-cups in all.</p>

<p class='c013'>The members of the Locustidæ (Fig. 26) appear to be better provided with
the organs of taste than any other Orthoptera, those of the katydid numbering
from 170 to 180. There are from 50 to 60 taste-cups in the front region; behind
the middle a group of 25 on each side, and over an area corresponding to the
base of the labrum and front edge of the clypeus is a sensory field with about
70 taste-cups on each side. They are true cups or beaker-like papillæ, some
with a fine, others with a short, stout, conical seta.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gustatory organs in the cave cricket (<i>Hadenœcus subterraneus</i>, Fig. 27),
from Mammoth Cave, are highly developed, being rounded papillæ with the
nucleus at the top or end. They are grouped on each side of the middle near
the front edge, there being 25 on each side. An irregular row of these beaker-like
organs extends along each side; some occur under the base of the labrum,
but they are most numerous in a field corresponding to the front edge of the
clypeus, there being 50 on each side, or 100 in all, where in Ceuthophilus there
are only 9 or 10. It would thus appear as if the sense of taste were much
more acute in the cave-dweller than in the out-of-doors form.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Coleoptera taste-cups and setæ are very generally distributed, though
we were unable to detect them in Dendroctonus or in <i>Lucanus dama</i>. As seen
in Fig. 57, we have observed numerous taste-pegs along the maxilla of <i>Nemognatha
lurida</i>, but otherwise taste-organs have only been detected in the epipharynx.
They not only occur in the adult beetles, but we have found them in
the larvæ of cerambycid, scarabæid, and other beetles. In the adults taste-cups
appear to be about as well developed in the carnivorous forms (Carabidæ)
as in the phytophagous or lignivorous groups.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Chlænius tomentosus</i> there are about half as many of these organs as in
Harpalus, while in Calosoma there are 90 taste-cups, 45 on each side, under the
base of the labrum. The cups are papilliform, being rather high, with a seta
arising from each.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Cicindelidæ, the epipharynx bears a sensory field quite different from
that of the Carabidæ. There are no normal taste-cups, except a few situated
on two large, round, raised areas which are guarded in front by a few very long
setæ. On the surface of each area are numerous very long setæ which may, if
not tactile, have some other sense, as they arise from cup-like bases or cells.
Those on the outside are like true taste-cups, with a bristle but little larger
than normal in taste-cups generally. We are disposed to regard this sensory
field as a highly specialized gustatory apparatus.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Dyticidæ the taste-cups are nearly as described in the Carabidæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Staphylinidæ are not well provided with taste-organs. Under the clypeus
of <i>Staphylinus violaceus</i>, on each side near the middle, is a bare rounded area,
in which are situated 4 or 5 papilliform taste-cups, and at the base behind them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>is another linear group of about 7 slenderer, somewhat curved, taste-cups. In
the Elateridæ these organs are scantily developed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Buprestidæ (<i>Buprestis maculiventris</i> alone examined) no true taste-cups
were detected. On the other hand, the Lampyridæ are well supplied with
them. Under the clypeus is situated a sensory field bearing 26 taste-cups, which
are rather smaller than usual. Over the epipharyngeal surface are scattered
a few taste-cups, but they are small and perhaps not gustatory. Under the
clypeus of <i>Lucidota punctata</i> Lec. is a group of 12 taste-cups, and in the middle
region of the epipharynx, situated in a field extending from near the base to near
the front edge, are about 40 taste-cups, which, however, are not, as is usual,
arranged on each side of the median line, but are scattered among the hairs of
the pilose surface of the epipharynx. In the Cleridæ the taste-cups are few in
number.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the great family of Scarabæidæ, the presence of gustatory organs is variable.
None occur in <i>Lucanus dama</i>, though in the June beetle (<i>Lachnosterna
fusca</i> Fröhl.) they are abundantly developed. The epipharynx bears on each
side outside of a spiny area a group of about 50 taste-cups, each bearing a long
seta, those on the outside of the area passing into a few high, rather slender,
papillæ, without a seta. On the under side of the clypeus is a median group of
10 taste-cups of singular form, the cups being large, with broad bases, which
posteriorly bear three spines, of which the median one is the largest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Taste-cups occur without any known exception in the longicorn beetles. In
<i>Leptura canadensis</i> they are numerous; in <i>Euryptera lateralis</i> they are abundant
along and near the middle of the anterior half of the labral region, and in
<i>Cyllene robiniæ</i> Forst. (or <i>pictus</i> Drury) they are more numerous than usual,
extending in an unbroken sensory field from near the front margin of the
clypeal region to near the front edge of the epipharynx. The cups vary much
in size, some being one-half as large as others; and those on the sides of the sensory
field bear short, and a few others rather long, bristles, showing that the
taste-cups are modified tactile bristles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Tenebrionidæ are fairly well endowed with taste-cups, their number in
<i>Eleodes obsoleta</i> Say amounting to 30 or 40.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of the Meloidæ especially are unusual in size and number.</p>

<div  class='figright id042'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Nemognatha lurida</i> Lec. (Fig. 289) the front edge of the epipharynx
contains about 80 remarkably small taste-cups, arranged irregularly in a triangular
sensory space, and not
more than ¼ to ⅙, as large as those
on the maxillæ of the same beetle.
Unless the former structures are
gustatory it is difficult to account
for their presence here, and it will
be observed that the taste-cups in
Epicauta are unusually abundant.
Thus in the middle and near the
front of the epipharynx of the
blister-beetle over 100 gustatory
cups were counted. They are
conical, papilliform, and truncated
at the end as if open, the edge of the opening being ragged, though
bearing no bristle, except in a few cases. Around the edge of the sinus, on
the under side of the labrum, is a regular marginal row of large, longer,
more distinctly chitinized taste-cups, whose walls are streaked up and down
by chitinous thickenings. In <i>E. callosa</i> Lec. there are about 55 taste-cups under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>the labrum, besides about 10 cells, which may be gustatory structures, situated
on either side of a median setose ridge which passes back under the clypeal
region.</p>

<p class='c013'>The taste-cups of the leaf-beetles are fairly numerous, judging from an examination
of <i>Diabrotica vittata</i>. The surface of the epipharynx is pilose, but
the median region is naked, and on the anterior half bears from 11 to 12 taste-cups,
arranged each side of the median line in a rude <span class='mono'>Y</span>. On each side, at the
base of the labial region, are two sensitive fields, each bearing about 25 to 26
taste-cups. More were seen under the clypeus.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Neuroptera unmistakable taste-cups are not always present. In
<i>Sialis infumata</i> along the median line of the epipharynx and near the front are
about 20 scattered gustatory pegs, which are minute, but longer and more
acute than usual. In <i>Chauliodes maculatus</i> there are one or two taste-cups
under the front edge of the clypeus; others are scattered along the middle
from the base of the labrum to the front, but are not arranged in definite order.
In <i>Corydalis cornutus</i> no sense-cups, pits, or rods are present. In Chrysopa
there are scattered cups armed with a short acute bristle, which are possibly
gustatory in function. In <i>Myrmeleon diversum</i> also the presence of sense-pits
or of taste-cups is doubtful, though a group of about 12 pits on each side of the
clypeal region of the epipharynx, and a few situated at the base of the labral
region, may be endowed with the sense of taste. In <i>Mantispa brunnea</i>, however,
along the middle of the epipharynx are scattered about 30 unmistakable
taste-cups, each bearing a short, fine hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Mecoptera (<i>Panorpa debilis?</i>) taste-cups, giving rise to a minute hair,
occur on the labium in two regions, and also on the maxillæ situated on the
stipes near the base of the palpi, and on the lacinia and galea. They are also
to be found on the maxillæ of <i>Boreus californicus</i>, but were not detected on the
labium.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were first detected by Reuter in various microlepidoptera, and occur on
the “basal spot” of the palpi of many butterflies. In a Tineid moth (<i>Coleophora
coruscipennella</i>) we have detected what we suppose to be a group of four
taste-pits on the inner side of the basal joint of the labial palpi.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Experimental proof.</b>—No one, says Lubbock, who has ever watched
a bee or wasp can entertain the slightest doubt as to their possession
of the sense of taste. “Forel mixed morphine and strychnine with
some honey, which he offered to his ants. Their antennæ gave them
no warning. The smell of the honey attracted them, and they began
to feed; but the moment the honey touched their lips they perceived
the fraud.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Will at first fed wasps with sugar, so that they frequently visited
it; afterwards he substituted alum for the sugar. Eagerly flying to
it, they had scarcely touched it when they drew back from the distasteful
substance with the most comical gestures, and cleaned their
tongues by frequently running them in and out, repeatedly stroking
them with their fore feet. He noticed a great repugnance to quinine
in nearly all the insects experimented on. Bees and wasps
were observed to have a more delicate gustatory sense than flies,
etc., which are more omnivorous in their tastes.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The organs of hearing</h4>

<p class='c016'>Although it has been denied by Forel that insects have the sense
of hearing, yet the majority of writers and experimenters agree that
insects are not deaf. On general grounds if, as we know, many insects
produce sounds, it must follow that they have ears to hear, for
there is every reason to suppose that the sounds thus made are, as in
other animals, either for attracting the sexes, for a means of communication,
or to express the emotions. We will begin by briefly
describing the structures now generally supposed to be auditory in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>function, and about which there can be no reasonable doubt, and
then consider the more problematical organs, closing with an account
of the extremely various means of producing sounds and cries.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The ears or tympanal and chordotonal sense-organs of Orthoptera and
other insects.</b>—The ears or tympana of locusts (Acrydiidæ) are situated
one on each side, on the basal joint of the abdomen, just behind
the first abdominal spiracle. That this is a true ear was first suggested
by J. Müller, and his opinion was confirmed by Siebold, Leydig,
Hensen, Graber, Schmidt, Lubbock, etc.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The apparatus consists of a tense membrane, the <i>tympanum</i>, surrounded
by a horny ring (Fig. 290). “On the internal surface of
this membrane are two horn-like processes (<i>o</i>, <i>u</i>), to which is attached
an extremely delicate vesicle (<i>bi</i>) filled with a transparent fluid, and
representing a membranous labyrinth. This vesicle is in connection
with an auditory nerve (<i>n</i>) which arises from the third thoracic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>ganglion, forms a ganglion (<i>ga</i>) upon the tympanum, and terminates
in the immediate neighborhood of the labyrinth by a collection of
cuneiform, staff-like bodies, with very finely pointed
extremities (primitive nerve-fibres?), which are surrounded
by loosely aggregated ganglionic globules”
(Siebold’s Anatomy of the Invertebrates).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the green grasshoppers, katydids, and their
allies, the ears are situated on the fore tibiæ, where
these organs can be found after a careful search
(Figs. 291, 292).</p>

<p class='c007'>The presence of the structure is indicated by the
oval disc, the drum, which is a thin tense membrane
covering the auditory apparatus of nerves,
ganglion cells, and auditory rods beneath.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tympana, or drums, are not present in all Locustidæ
and Gryllidæ, and, as Lubbock states, it is an additional
reason for regarding them as auditory organs, that in those
species which possess no stridulating organs the tympana
are also wanting. In many of the Locustidæ the tympana are covered or protected
by a fold of the skin projecting over them. These covered ones are,
Graber thinks, derived from the open ones.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On examining the apparatus within the leg under the drum, it is
seen to consist of the trachea, the auditory vesicles and rods, ganglion
cells, and acoustic nerve. The trachea is greatly modified
(Fig. 292, <i>Tr</i> 1). On passing into the tibia the trachea enlarges and
divides into two branches, which reunite lower down. The spiracles
supplying the air to this enlarged trachea are considerably enlarged,
while in the dumb species it is of the normal size. The enlarged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>trachea passes close to the tympanum, which thus has air on both
sides of it: the open air on the outer, the air of the trachea on its
inner surface. In fact, as Lubbock states, “the trachea acts like the
Eustachian tube in our own ear; it maintains
an equilibrium of pressure on each
side of the tympanum, and enables it
freely to transmit the atmospheric vibrations.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>These tracheæ, says Graber, though formed
on a similar plan, present many variations, corresponding
to those of the tympana, and showing
that the tympana and the tracheæ stand in
intimate connection with one another. For
instance, in those species where the tympana are
equal, the tracheæ are so likewise; in Gryllotalpa,
where the front tympanum only is developed,
though both tracheal branches are present, the
front one is much larger than the other; and
where there is no tympanum,
the trachea remains
comparatively small, and
even in some cases undivided
(Lubbock, <i>ex</i> Graber).</p>

<p class='c007'>The acoustic nerve,
which next to the optic
is the thickest in the
body, divides soon after
entering the tibia into
two branches, one almost
immediately
forming a ganglion, the
supra-tympanal ganglion,
the other passing
down to the tympanum,
where it expands
into an elongated flat
ganglion, the organ of Siebold (Fig. 293),
and closely applied to the anterior
tracheæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the upper part of the ganglion is a
group terminating below in a single row
of vesicles, the first few of which are
approximately equal, but which subsequently
diminish regularly in size. Each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of these vesicles is connected with the nerve by a fibril (Fig. 293,
<i>vN</i>), and contains an auditory rod (Fig. 294). They are said by
Graber to be brightly refractive, hollow (thus differing from the
retinal rods, which are solid), and terminate in a separate end-piece
(<i>ko</i>). The rods were first discovered by Siebold, and, as Lubbock
remarks, may be regarded as specially characteristic of the acoustic
organs of insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>As will be seen in Fig. 293, at the upper part of the tibial organ of Ephippigera
there is a group of cells, and below them a single row of cells gradually
diminishing in size from above downwards.
“One cannot but ask oneself,”
says Lubbock, “whether the gradually
diminishing size of the cells in the organ
of Siebold may not have reference to the
perception of different notes, as is the
case with the series of diminishing arches
in the organ of Corti of our own ears.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These organs were supposed to be
restricted to the Orthoptera, but in 1877
Lubbock discovered what seems to resemble
the supra-tympanal auditory organ
of Orthoptera in the tibia of the yellow
ant (<i>Lasius flavus</i>). Graber confirmed
Lubbock’s account, and also discovered
these organs in the tibia of a Perlid
(<i>Isopteryx apicalis</i>), and Fritz Müller has
detected them in the fore tibiæ of the
nymph of <i>Calotermes rugosus</i> (Fig. 295).
To these structures Graber gave the name
of chordotonal organs.</p>

<p class='c013'>He has also detected these organs in all
the legs of other insects (Trichoptera,
Pediculidæ), and auditory rods have been discovered in the antennæ of Dyticus
and of Telephorus by Hicks, Leydig, and Graber. Graber classifies the chordotonal
organs into truncal and membral. In Coleoptera and Trichoptera they
may occur on several joints of the leg; others are more localized,—thus he distinguishes
femoral (Pediculidæ), tibial (Orthoptera, Perlidæ, Formicidæ), and
tarsal organs (Coleoptera).</p>

<p class='c013'>A type of chordotonal organ, observed in the body-segments of the larvæ of
several insects by Leydig, Weismann, Graber, Grobben, and Bolles Lee, is to
be seen in the transparent larva of Corethra (Fig. 296), where the auditory
organ extends to the skin. It contains at the point <i>cs</i> two or three auditory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>rods. In the opposite direction a fine ligament (<i>cl</i>) passes from <i>cg</i> to the skin;
in this way the auditory organ is suspended in a certain state of tension, and is
favorably situated to receive even very fine vibrations. A similar apparatus
has been detected in the larva of Ptychoptera.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Antennal auditory hairs.</b>—It is not at all improbable that the
antennæ of different insects contain auditory as well as olfactory
structures. Lubbock has suggested that the singular organs which
have only been found in the antennæ of ants and certain bees, and
to which he gives the name of “Hicks’ bottles” (Fig. 281), may act
as microscopic stethoscopes, while Leydig also regards them as
chordotonal organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>That, however, some of the antennal hairs of the mosquito, as first
suggested by Johnson and afterwards proved experimentally by
Mayer, are auditory, seems well established. Fastening a male
mosquito down on a glass slide, Mayer then sounded a series of
tuning-forks. With an Ut<sub>4</sub> fork of 512 vibrations per second, some
of the hairs were seen to vibrate vigorously, while others remained
comparatively at rest. The lower (Ut<sub>3</sub>) and higher (Ut<sub>5</sub>) harmonics
of Ut<sub>4</sub> also caused more vibration than any intermediate notes.
These hairs, then, are specially tuned so as to respond to vibrations
numbering 512 per second. Other hairs vibrated to other
notes, extending through the middle and next higher octave of the
piano.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mayer then made large wooden models of these hairs, the one
corresponding to the Ut<sub>3</sub> hair being about a metre in length, and on
counting the number of vibrations they made when they were
clamped at one end and then drawn on one side, he found that it
“coincided with the ratio existing between the numbers of vibrations
of the forks to which covibrated the fibrils,” or hairs. It
should be observed that the song of the female mosquito corresponds
nearly to this note, and would consequently set the hairs in vibration.
Mayer observed that the song of the female vibrates the hairs
of one of the antennæ more forcibly than those of the other. Those
auditory hairs are most affected which are at right angles to the
direction from which the sound comes. Hence from the position of
the antennæ and the hairs a sound will be loudest or most intense if
it is directly in front of the head. If, then, the song of the female
affects one antenna more than another, the male turns his head until
the two antennæ are equally affected, and is thus able to fly straight
towards the female. From his experiments Mayer found that the
male can thus guide himself to within 5° of the direction of the
female. Hence he concludes that “these insects must have the faculty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>of the perception of the direction of sound more highly developed
than in any other class of animals.” (Also see Child’s work.)</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Special sense-organs in the wings and halteres.</b>—Organs of a special sense,
which Hicks supposed to be those of smell, were found by him near or at the
base of the wings of Diptera, Coleoptera, and less perfect ones in Lepidoptera,
Neuroptera, and Orthoptera, with a trace of them in Hemiptera; but these
were considered by Leydig to be auditory organs, since he found the nerves to
end in club-shaped rods, like those of Orthoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hicks found, as to the halteres and their sense-organs, that the nerve in the
halter is the largest in the insect, except the optic nerve; and that at the base
of the halteres is a number of vesicles arranged in four groups, to each of
which the nerve sends a branch. Afterwards Bolles Lee discovered that the
vesicles, undoubtedly perforated, contain a minute hair, those of the upper
groups being protected by hoods of chitin. He regarded them as olfactory
organs, while Lubbock seems inclined to consider them as auditory structures.
Graber also regards the vesicles of Hicks as chordotonal organs.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his elaborate account of the balancers, Weinland concludes that the
organs of sense of varying structure occurring at the base of these appendages
allow the perception of movements which the halteres perform and which
enable the fly to steer or direct its course. The halteres can thus cause differences
in the direction of the flight of a fly in the vertical plane. If the balancers
act unequally, there is a change in direction.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>e.</i> The sounds of insects</h4>

<p class='c016'>Insects have no true voice; but sounds of different intensity,
shrill cries, and other noises are produced mechanically by insects,
either being love-songs to attract the sexes, to give signals, to communicate
intelligence, or perhaps to express the emotions. The
loud, shrill cry of the Cicada, or chirp of the cricket, is evidently a
love-call, and results in the mating of individuals of separate broods
more or less widely scattered, thus preventing too close interbreeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>The simplest means of making a noise is that of the death-watch
(Anobium), which strikes or taps on the wall with its head or
abdomen. Longicorn beetles make a sharp sound by the friction
of the mesoscutellum against the edge of the prothoracic cavity, the
head being alternately raised and lowered, Burying-beetles (Necrophorus)
rub the abdomen against the hinder edges of the elytra.
Weevils make a loud noise by rapidly rubbing the tips of the abdomen
on the ends of the elytra.</p>

<p class='c013'>Landois offers the following summary of the kinds of noises produced by
beetles:</p>

    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd> <i>j.</i> Friction of the wing against the abdominal segments (<i>Melolontha fullo</i>).
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c013'>Mutilla makes a rather sharp noise by rubbing one abdominal segment
against another. Ants (Ponera) have a stridulating apparatus, and other
genera numerous (20) ridges between the segments.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even certain moths and butterflies emit a rasping or crackling noise. The
death’s-head moth and other sphinges cause it by rubbing the palpi against the
base of the proboscis. These and certain butterflies are provided with parallel
ridges forming a rasp on the “basal spot” of the inner side of the basal joint of
each palpus (Reuter). A South American butterfly (<i>Ageronia feronia</i>) can be
heard for several yards as it flies with a crackling sound. Hampson finds
that the cause of the clicking sound is due to a pair of strong chitinous hooks
attached to the thorax, against which play the spatulate ends of a pair of hooks
attached to the fore wings. An Australian moth (Hecatesia) flies with a whizzing
sound; Vanessa is said to be sonorous.</p>

<p class='c013'>The males of Orthoptera produce their shrill cries or chirping noises, 1, by
rubbing the thighs against the sides of the body (Acrydiidæ); 2, by the friction
of the base of the fore wings on each other (Locustidæ); 3, by rubbing
the base of the upper on the base of the hinder or under pair (Gryllidæ), in
the two last there being a shrilling apparatus consisting of a file on the hind
wings, which rubs on a resonant surface on the fore wings. The females are
not invariably dumb, both sexes of the European Ephippigera being able to
faintly stridulate. Corixa also produces shrill chirping notes. (Carpenter.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain insects also hum, and have what may perhaps be called a
voice. The cockchafer, besides humming with the wings, produces a
sound almost like a voice. In the large trachea, just behind each
spiracle, is a chitinous process, which is thrown into vibrations by
the air during respiration, and thus produces a humming noise.
(Lubbock.) Such is also the case with flies, the mosquito, dragon-flies,
and bees. In flies and dragon-flies the “voice” is caused by
the air issuing from the thoracic spiracles; while in the humble-bee
the abdominal spiracles are also musical. The sound made by the
spiracles bears no relation to that caused by the wings. Landois
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>tells us that the wing-tone of the honey-bee is A′; its voice, however,
is an octave higher, and often goes to B″ and C″.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sounds produced by the wings are constant in each species,
except where, as in Bombus, there are individuals of different sizes;
in these the larger ones generally give a higher note. Thus the
comparatively small male of <i>Bombus terrestris</i> hums on A′, while the
large female hums an entire octave higher.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the note produced the rapidity of the vibrations can be calculated.
For example, the house-fly, which produces the sound of F,
vibrates its wings 21,120 times in a minute, or 335 times in a second;
and the bee, which makes a sound of A′, as many as 26,400 times, or
440 times in a second. On the contrary, a tired bee hums on E′, and
therefore, according to theory, vibrates its wings only 330 times in a
second. Marey has confirmed these numbers graphically, and found
by experiment that the fly actually makes 330 strokes in a second.
(Lubbock.)</p>

<p class='c007'>A different kind of musical apparatus is that of the cicada, which
has been elaborately described by Graber. The shrill, piercing notes
issue from a pair of organs on the under side of the base of the abdomen
of the male, these acting somewhat as two kettle-drums, the
membrane covering the depressions being rapidly vibrated.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In certain larval insects,
as those of the Proctotrypidæ
(first larval stage), the higher
Hymenoptera (ichneumons,
ants, wasps, and bees, Fig.
301), in the Campodea-like
larvæ of the Meloidæ and
Stylopidæ, the larva of the
ant-lion (Myrmecoleo), and
those of <i>Diptera pupipara</i>
(Melophagus), the embryonic
condition of the separation of
the proctodæum and mid-gut
(mesenteron) persists, the
stomach ending in a blind
sac; in such cases the intestine,
together with the urinary
tubes, is entirely secretory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anus is wanting in
the larva of the ant-lion, as
also in the wasps (in which
there is a rudimentary colon)
and in freshly hatched bees,
though it becomes perfectly
formed in the fully grown larvæ (Newport, art. Insecta, p. 967, and
H. Müller).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larvæ of lamellicorn Coleoptera (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>) the
digestive tube is nearly as simple as in bees, though there is a large
colon, which at its beginning forms an immense cœcum, and has also
one anal aperture (Newport).</p>

<p class='c007'>The length and shape of the digestive canal is dependent on the
nature of the food and also on the mode of life, especially the ease
or difficulty with which the food is digested.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Newport, while stating that the length of the alimentary canal in larvæ is not
in general indicatory of the habits of the species, makes this qualification after
describing the digestive canal of Calandra as compared with that of Calosoma:
“The length and complication of the intestines, therefore, appear to have some
reference to the quality of the food to be digested, since it is well known that
the food of these latter insects (weevils) is of difficult assimilation, being as it
is chiefly the hard ligneous fibres of vegetable matter; but they cannot be received
as always indicatory of a carnivorous [or] vegetable feeder, since, as
above remarked, the length of the canal is considerable in one entirely carnivorous
larva, while it is much shorter in some herbivorous, and particularly in
pollenivorous larvæ, as in the Melolontha and the apodal Hymenoptera.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id065'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Newport also contends that the length of the alimentary canal is not more
indicative in the perfect insect of the carnivorous or phytophagous habits of the
species than in the larva. It is nearly as long (being from two to three times
the length of the whole body), and is more complicated, in the rapacious
Carabidæ (Fig. 302) than in the honey-sipping Lepidoptera, whose food is entirely
liquid. Referring to the digestive canal of Cicindelidæ, which is scarcely
longer than the body, he claims that “we cannot admit that the length of the
digestive organs, and the existence of a gizzard and gastric vessels, are indicatory
of predacity of habits in the insect, because a similar conformation of parts
exists often in strictly vegetable feeders. The existence and length of these
parts seem rather to refer to the comparative digestibility of the food than to its
animal or vegetable nature.” Newport then refers to the digestive canal of
Forficulidæ (in which the gizzard is present, the canal, however, passing in an
almost direct line through the body, making but one slight convolution), “a
farther proof that the <i>length</i> of the canal must not be taken as a criterion
whereby to judge of the habits of a species.” He adds this will apply equally
well to the omnivorous Gryllidæ, in which there exists a short alimentary canal,
but a gizzard of more complicated structure than that of the Dytiscidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>In larval insects and others (Synaptera, Orthoptera, etc.), in which
the digestive canal is simplest, it is scarcely longer than the body,
and passes through it as a straight tube.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the caterpillar, which is a voracious and constant feeder, the
digestive canal is a large straight tube, not clearly differentiated into
fore-stomach, stomach, and intestine; but in the imago, which only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>takes a little liquid food, it is slender, delicate, and highly differentiated.
In the larva the mid-gut forms the largest part of the canal; in
the imago, the intestine becomes very long and coiled into numerous
turns; at the same time the food-reservoir (the “sucking stomach”)
develops, and the excretory tubes are longer.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It will greatly simplify our conception of the anatomy of the
digestive canal if we take into account its mode of origin in the
embryo, bearing in mind the fact that during the gastrula condition
the ectoderm is invaginated at each pole to form the primitive mouth
and fore-gut (stomodæum) and hind-gut (proctodæum). The cells of
the ectoderm secrete a chitinous lining (intima), which forms the
continuation of the outer chitinous crust, and thus the lining of each
end of the digestive canal is cast whenever the insect molts; while
the mid-intestine (mesenteron), arising independently of the rest of
the canal much later
in embryonic life
from the mesoderm,
is not the result of
any invagination,
being directly derived
from the mesoderm,
and is not lined with
chitin.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The mouth, or oral
cavity, and pharynx.</b>—This
is the beginning
of the alimentary
bounded above by the
clypeus, and labrum, with the epipharynx, and below by the hypopharynx,
or tongue, as well as the labium. Into it pour the secretion
of the salivary glands, which passes out through an opening at the
base of the tongue or hypopharynx. On each side of the mouth are
the mandibles and first maxillæ.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The sucking or pharyngeal pump.</b>—This organ has been observed by
Graber in flies and Hemiptera, but the fullest account is that by
Burgess, who was the first to discover it in Lepidoptera. In the
milk-weed butterfly (<i>Danais archippus</i>) the canal traversing the proboscis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>opens into a pharynx enclosed in a muscular sac (Figs. 303,
304, and 310).</p>

<p class='c007'>The pharyngeal sac, says Burgess, serves as a pumping organ to
suck the liquid food through the proboscis and to force it backwards
into the digestive canal.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Meinert (“Trophi Dipterorum”) has made elaborate dissections of
the mouth and its armature, including the pharynx of several types
of Diptera, with its musculature. He describes the pharynx as the
principal, and in most Diptera, as the only part of the pump (antlia),
and says: “By the muscles of the pump (<i>musculis antliæ</i>) the superior
lamina of the pharynx is varied that the space between the two
laminæ may be increased,
and the liquid is thus led
through the siphon formed
by the mouth-parts into the
mouth” (Fig. 81).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The œsophagus.</b>—This is a
simple tube, largest in those
insects feeding on solid,
usually vegetable, food, and
smallest in those living on
liquid food. It usually
curves upwards and backwards,
passing directly under
the brain, and merges into
the crop or proventriculus
either at the back part of the
head or in the thorax, its
length being very variable.
Its inner walls longitudinally
are folded and lined
with chitin.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Newport, in
the œsophagus of the Gryllidæ, of the two layers of the mucous
lining the second is distinctly glandular and secretory, and in it
there are many thousands of very minute granular glandular bodies,
which probably secrete the “molasses” or repellent fluid often
ejected by these and other insects when captured.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The crop or ingluvies.</b>—This, when present, is an enlargement of
the end of the œsophagus, and lined internally with a muscular coat.
It is very large in locusts (Fig. 298), Anabrus (Fig. 299), and other
Orthoptera (the Phasmidæ excepted), in the Dermaptera, and most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>adult Coleoptera. A crop-like dilatation in front of a spherical gizzard
is also present in the Synaptera (Poduridæ and Lepismidæ),
as well as in the Mallophaga
(Nirmidæ).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larvæ of weevils (<i>Calandra

(Fig. 305), but not in the larva
of Calosoma; also, according to
Beauregard, in the pollen-eating
beetles Zonitis, Sitaris, and Malabris
it is wanting, while in Meloe it is highly developed (Kolbe).</p>

<p class='c007'>The crop forms a lateral dilatation of the end of the œsophagus in

pouch connected by a slender neck with the end of the œsophagus

Termitidæ), in Trichoptera, and in Mecoptera (Panorpidæ). In
most adult Neuroptera (Myrmeleonidæ, Hemerobiidæ, and Sialidæ),
but not in Rhaphidiidæ, the long œsophagus is dilated posteriorly
into a kind of pouch or crop, and besides there is often a long “food-reservoir”
arising on one of its sides, that of Myrmeleon (Fig. 307)
and Hemerobius being on the right side.</p>

<p class='c007'>A true food-reservoir is present in most Diptera (Fig. 308) as well
as in the larvæ of the Muscidæ, but according to Dufour it is wanting
in some Asilidæ and in <i>Diptera pupipara</i>, and according to
Brauer in the Œstridæ. The food-reservoir in Diptera is always
situated on the left side of the digestive canal; there is usually a
long neck or canal, while the reservoir is either oval or more usually
bilobed, and often each lobe is itself curiously lobed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lepidoptera (Figs. 309, 310) the so-called “sucking stomach”
is, as Graber has proved, simply a reservoir for the temporary reception
of food; though generally found to contain nothing but air,
Newport has observed that in flies it is filled with food after feeding.
He has found this to be the case in the flesh fly, and in Eristalis he
has found it “partially filled with yellow pollen from the flowers of
the ragwort upon which the insect was captured,” the pollen grains
also occurring in the canal leading to the bag, in the gullet, and in
the stomach itself. Graber has further proved by feeding flies with
a colored sweet fluid that this sac is only a food-receptacle. As he
says: “It can be seen filling itself fuller and fuller with the colored
fluid, the sac gradually distending until it occupies half the hind-body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The food-reservoir of the Hymenoptera is a lateral pouch at the
end of the long, slender œsophagus, and has been seen in the bee to
be filled with honey.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mole-cricket the hinder part of the crop is armed within
with hook-like bristles directed backwards so as not to prevent the
energetic pressure of the food backwards
into the proventriculus, and to obviate the
possibility of a regurgitation. (Eberli.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The fore-stomach or proventriculus.</b>—This
is especially well developed in the Dermaptera,
in the Orthopterous families
Locustidæ, Gryllidæ, and Mantidæ, while
in the Thysanura (Lepisma) there is a
spherical gizzard provided with six teeth.
It also occurs in many wood-boring insects,
and in most carnivorous insects,
notably the Carabidæ, Dyticidæ, Scolytidæ,
in the Mecoptera (scorpion-flies), in
the fleas, and in many kinds of ants, as
well as Cynips, Leucospis, and Xyphidria.
It is very muscular, lined within with
chitin, which is usually provided with
numerous teeth arising from the folds.
These folds begin in the œsophagus or
crop, and suddenly end where the mesenteron
(“chylific stomach”) begins. It has
been compared with the gizzard of birds,
and is usually called by German authors
the chewing or masticating stomach.
(Kaumagen.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The proventriculus is best developed in the
Gryllidæ (<i>Acrida viridissima</i>), where the six folds
at the end of the crop close together to form a valve
between the crop and proventriculus. “They
are each armed with five very minute hooked
teeth; and, continued into the gizzard, develop
many more in their course through that organ.
These first teeth are arranged around the
entrance to the gizzard, and seem designed to
retain the insufficiently comminuted food and to
pass it on to that organ.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next to these in succession on each of the
longitudinal ridges are four flat, broad, somewhat
quadrate teeth, each of which is very finely denticulated along its free margin. These extend about half-way through the gizzard.
They appear to be alternately elevated and depressed during the action of the gizzard,
and to serve to carry on the food to the twelve cutting teeth, with which
each ridge is also armed, and which occupy the posterior part of the organ. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>teeth are triangular, sharp-pointed, and directed posteriorly, and gradually
decrease in size in succession from before backward. Each tooth is very
strong, sharp-pointed, and of the color and consistence of tortoise shell, and is
armed on each side by a smaller pointed tooth. These form the six longitudinal
ridges of the gizzard, between each two of which there are two other rows of
very minute teeth of a triangular form, somewhat resembling the larger one in
structure, occupying the channels between the ridges. The muscular portion of
the gizzard is equally interesting. It is not merely formed of transverse and
longitudinal fibres, but sends from its inner surface into the cavity of each of
the large teeth other minute but powerful muscles, a pair of which are inserted
into each tooth. The number of teeth in the gizzard amounts to 270, which is
the same number in these Gryllidæ as found formerly by Dr. Kidd in the mole-cricket.
Of the different kinds of teeth there are as follows: 72 large treble
teeth, 24 flat quadrate teeth, 30 small single-hooked teeth, and 12 rows of small
triangular teeth, each row being formed of 12 teeth. This is the complicated
gizzard of the higher Orthoptera.” (Newport.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In the more generalized cockroach, there are six principal folds, the so-called
teeth, which project so far inwards as to nearly meet (Fig. 312). The entire
apparatus of muscles and teeth is, as Miall and Denny state, “an elaborate
machine for squeezing and straining the food, and recalls the gastric mill and
pyloric strainer of the crayfish. The powerful annular muscles approximate
the teeth and folds, closing the passage, while small longitudinal muscles, which
can be traced from the chitinous teeth to the cushions, appear to retract these
last, and open a passage for the food.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the fore-stomach or proventriculus of the lobster, the solid,
rounded teeth do not appear to triturate the solid fragments found
in the organ, but act rather as a pyloric strainer to keep such bodies
out of the chylific stomach. We accept the view of Plateau that this
section of the digestive canal in insects, which he compares to the
psalterium of a ruminant, is a strainer rather than a masticatory stomach,
and both Forel and Emery, as well as Cheshire, take this view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proventriculus of the honey-bee (Fig. 313, <i>hs</i>) is called by
apiarians the “honey-sac” or “honey-stomach.” Cheshire states
that if it be carefully removed from a freshly killed bee, its calyx-like
“stomach-mouth” may be seen to gape open and shut with a
rapid snapping movement. The entrance to the stomach is guarded
by four valves, each of which is strongly chitinous within, and
fringed along its edge with downward-pointing fine stiff bristles.
By the contraction of the longitudinal muscles (<i>lm</i>), the valves open
to allow the passage of food from the honey-sac to the “chyle-stomach.”
It is closed at will by circular muscles (<i>tm</i>). Then the
bee can carry food for a week’s necessities, either using it rapidly in
the production of wax, or eking it out if the weather is unfavorable
for the gathering of a new store.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Cheshire also shows that when bees suck up from composite and other
flowers nectar together with much pollen, the outside wrinkled membrane (<i>sm</i>,
<i>A</i>, Fig. 314) “is seen to continually run up in folds, and gather itself over the
top of the stomach-mouth, bringing with it, by the aid of its setæ, the large
pollen-grains the nectar contains.” The lips (<i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>B</i>, Fig. 314), now opening,
take in this pollen, which is driven forwards into the cavity made between the
separating lips by an inflow of the fluid surrounding the granules. The lips in
turn close, but the down-pointing bristles are thrown outwards from the face of
the leaflet, in this way revealing their special function, as the pollen is prevented
from receding while the nectar passes back into the honey-sac, strained through
between the bristles aforesaid, the last parts escaping by the loop-like openings
seen in the corners of <i>C</i>, Fig. 314. The whole process is immediately and very
rapidly repeated, so that the pollen collects and the honey is cleared. “Three
purposes, in addition to those previously enumerated, are thus subserved by
this wondrous mechanism. First, the bee can either <i>eat or drink</i> from the
mixed diet she carries, gulping down the pollen in pellets, or swallowing the
nectar as her necessities demand. Second, when the collected pollen is driven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>forwards into the chyle-stomach, the tube extension, whose necessity now
becomes apparent, prevents the pellets forming into plug-like masses just below
<i>p</i>, Fig. 313, for, by the action of the tube, these pellets are delivered into the
midst of the fluids of the stomach, to be at once broken up and subjected to the
digestive process. And third, while the little gatherer is flying from flower to
flower, her stomach-mouth is busy in separating pollen from nectar, so that the
latter may be less liable to fermentation and better suited to winter consumption.
She, in fact, carries with her, and at once puts into operation, the most
ancient, and yet the most perfect and beautiful, of all ‘honey-strainers.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Forel’s experiments on the proventriculus of ants prove that through its
valvular contrivance it closes the passage from the crop to the mid-intestine
(“chylific stomach”), and allows the contents of the former to pass slowly
and very gradually into the latter. Emery confirms this view, and concludes
that the organ in the Camponotidæ and in the Dolichoderidæ provided with a
calyx-bell, usually regarded as a triturating stomach (Kaumagen), but more
correctly as a pumping stomach, consists of parts which perform two different
functions. Under the operation of the muscles of the crop the entrance to the
pumping stomach becomes closed, in order by such spasmodic contraction to
prevent the flow of the contents of the crop into the proventriculus. By the
pressure of the transverse muscles of the proventriculus its contents are emptied
into the mid-intestine, while simultaneously a regurgitation into the crop is prevented.
In the Dolichoderidæ and Plagiolepidinæ the closure in both cases is
effected by the valves. In the true Camponotidæ there are two separate contrivances
for closing; the calyx belonging to the crop-musculature, while the
valves essentially belong to the proventricular pumping apparatus.</p>

<p class='c013'>Opinions vary as to the use of this portion of the digestive canal. Graber
compares it to the gizzard of birds, and likens the action of the rosette of teeth
to the finer radiating teeth of the sea-urchin, and styles it a chopping machine,
which works automatically, and allows no solid bits of food to pass in to injure
the delicate walls of the stomach (mid-gut).</p>

<p class='c013'>He also states that the food when taken from the proventriculus is very finely
divided, while that found in the œsophagus contains large bits.</p>

<p class='c013'>Kolbe says that this view has recently been completely abandoned, and that
the teeth are used to pass the food backwards into the chylific stomach. “But
Goldfuss had denied the triturating action of the proventriculus of the Orthoptera
(Symbolæ ad Orthopterorum quorundam Œconomiam, 1843), stating
that the contents of the same are already fluid in the gullet, so that the fore-stomach
(Kaumagen) does not need to comminute the food” (Kolbe). In the
Gryllidæ and Locustidæ, just before the posterior opening of the proventriculus
into the stomach the chitinous lining swells into a ring and projects straight
back as the inner wall of the cylindrical chylific stomach. The muscular layer
forms two sac-like outgrowths or folds, which separate on the circular fold
from the chitinous membrane. This apparatus only allows very finely comminuted
food to pass into the stomach.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Acrydiidæ (<i>Eremobia muricata</i>) at the end of the proventriculus,
where it passes into the stomach, is a small circular fold which hangs down
like a curtain in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The œsophageal valve.</b>—Weismann<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> states that the origin of the
proventriculus in the embryo of flies (Muscidæ) shows that it should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>be regarded as an intussusception of the œsophagus. While in the
embryo the invaginated portion of the œsophagus is short, after the
hatching of the larva it projects backwards into the mid-intestine.
Kowalevsky also observed in
a young muscid larva, 2.2 mm.
in length, that the œsophagus,
shaped like a tube, extends
back into the expanded portion
(proventriculus) and
opens into the stomach (Fig.
315, <i>A</i>). In a larva 10 mm.
long the funnel is shorter, the
end being situated in the proventriculus
(Fig. 315, <i>B</i>, <i>pr</i>). In
the cavity between the outer
(<i>o</i>) and inner wall (<i>i</i>) no food
enters, and the use of this
whole apparatus seems to be
to prevent the larger bits of
food from passing into the chylific
stomach (Kowalevsky).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Beauregard has found a similar structure in the Meloidæ, and calls it the
“cardiac valvule” (Fig. 318, <i>Kl</i>). It was observed by Mingazzini in the larvæ
of phytophagic lamellicorn beetles, and Balbiani described it in a myriopod
(Cryptops) under the name of the “œsophageal valvule.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Gehuchten describes a homologous but more complicated structure in a
tipulid larva (<i>Ptychoptera contaminata</i>), but differing in containing blood-cavities,
as a tubular prolongation of the posterior end of the œsophagus which
passes through the proventriculus and opens at various positions in the anterior
part of the chylific stomach (Fig. 316).</p>

<p class='c013'>The three layers composing this funnel are distant from each other and
separated by blood-cavities, the whole forming “an immense blood-cavity
extended between the epithelial proventricular lining and the muscular coat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>According to Schneider the longitudinal muscular fibres of the fore and
hind gut in insects pass into the stomach (mid-gut). The anterior part of the
fore-gut has generally only circular fibres. When, however, the longitudinal
fibres arise behind the middle, then they separate from the digestive canal and
are inserted a little behind the beginning of the chylific stomach. Hence there
is formed an invagination of the proventriculus, which projects into the cavity of
the stomach.</p>

<p class='c013'>Schneider describes this process, which he calls the “beak,” as an invagination
of the fore-stomach which projects into the cavity of the stomach. The
two layers of the invagination in growing together form a beak varying in shape,
being either simple or lobed and armed with bristles or teeth. This beak is
tolerably large in Lepisma, Dermaptera (Forficula), Orthoptera, and in the
larvæ and adults of Diptera, but smaller in the Neuroptera and Coleoptera,
while in other insects it is wanting.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span><b>Proventricular valvule.</b>—Gehuchten also describes in Ptychoptera what he
calls “the proventricular valvule,” stating that it is “a circular fold of the
intestinal wall” (Fig. 310, <i>vpr</i>). He claims that it has not before been found,
the “proventricular beak” of Schneider being regarded by him as the œsophageal
valvule.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The peritrophic membrane.</b>—This membrane appears first to have
been noticed by Ramdohr in 1811 in <i>Hemerobius perla</i>. It has been
found by Schneider, who calls it the “funnel.” On the hinder end
of the fore-stomach, he says, the cuticula forms a fold enclosing the
outlet of the fore-stomach, and extending back like a tube to the
anus. This “funnel,” he adds, occurs in a great number of insects.
It has been found in Thysanura, but is wanting in Hemiptera. In
the Coleoptera it is absent in Carabidæ and Dyticidæ. It is generally
present in Diptera and in the larvæ of Lepidoptera, but not in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>the adults. In Hymenoptera it has been found in ants and wasps,
but is absent in Cynipidæ, Ichneumonidæ, and Tenthredinidæ. All
those insects (including their larvæ) possessing this funnel eat solid,
indigestible food, while those which do not possess it take fluid
nourishment. It is elastic, and firmly encloses the contents of the
digestive tract. Until Schneider’s discovery of its general occurrence,
it had only been known to exist in the viviparous Cecidomyia
larvæ (Miastor). Wagner, its discoverer, noticed in the stomach of
this insect a second tube which contained food. Pagenstecher was
inclined to regard the tube as a secretion of the salivary glands.
Metschnikoff, however, more correctly stated that the tube consisted
of chitin, but he regarded it as adapted for the removal of the secretions.
(Schneider.) Plateau, however, as well as Balbiani, the latter
calling it the “peritropic membrane,” considers this membrane as a
secretion of the chylific stomach, and that it is formed at the surface
of the epithelial cells. It surrounds the food along the entire digestive
tract, forming an envelope around the fæcal masses. On the
other hand, Gehuchten states that in the larva of Ptychoptera its
mode of origin differs from that described by Plateau and by
Schneider, and that it is a product of secretion of special cells in the
proventriculus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The mid-intestine.</b>—This section of the digestive canal, often,
though erroneously, called the “chylific stomach” or ventriculus,
differs not only in its embryonic history, but also in its structure
and physiology from the fore and hind intestine of arthropods, and
also presents no analogy to the stomach of the vertebrate animals.
In insects it is a simple tube, not usually lined with chitin, since it
is not formed by the invagination of the ectoderm, as are the fore
and hind intestine, the absence of the chitinous intima promoting
the absorption of soluble food. Into the anterior end either open
two or more large cœcal tubes (Fig. 299), or its whole outer surface
is beset with very numerous fine glandular filaments like villi
(Fig. 317 and Fig. 329).</p>

<p class='c007'>The mid-intestine varies much in size and shape; it is very long
in the lamellicorn beetles (Melolontha and Geotrupes), and while in
Meloë it is very large, occupying the greatest part of the body-cavity,
in the longicorn beetles and in Lepidoptera it is very small. The
pyloric end consists of an internal circular fold projecting into the
cavity. In the Psocidæ (Cæcilius) the pyloric end is prolonged into
a slender tube nearly as long as the larger anterior portion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The limits between the mid and hind intestine are in some insects
difficult to define, the urinary tubes sometimes appearing to open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>into the end of the mid-intestine (“stomach”). The latter also is
sometimes lined with an intima. The limits are also determined
by a circular projection, directly
behind which is an enlargement of
the intestine in the shape of a
trench (<i>rigole</i>), or circular <i>cul-de-sac</i>
(the “pyloric valvule” of some
authors, including Beauregard),
while the walls of the small intestine
contract so as to produce a
considerable constriction of the cavity of the canal.
This constriction exactly coincides with the beginning
of the double layer of circular muscles in the wall of
the small intestine. An internal layer,
which is the continuation of the circular
muscles of the chylific stomach,
and an external layer much more
developed probably belong to this
part of the alimentary canal. Since
the homologue of the circular fold
occurs in the locust as well as in
Diptera, it is probably common to
insects in general.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gehuchten adds that the limit set by the
circular projection does not exactly coincide
with the opening into the intestine of the
urinary tubes and the two annexed glands.
He shows by a section (his Fig. 133) that the
tubular glands open into the alimentary canal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>in front of the circular fold. It is the same with the Malpighian tubes. They
are not, therefore, he claims, dependences of the terminal intestine, but of the
mid-intestine. Beauregard has observed the same thing in the vesicating insects
(Meloidæ). The Malpighian tubes, he says, open into the “chylific stomach”
before the valvular crown. This arrangement does not seem to be general,
because, according to Balbiani, the Malpighian vessels open into the beginning
of the intestine in Cryptops. Compare also Minot’s account of the valve in
locusts separating the stomach from the intestine, and in front of which the
urinary or Malpighian tubes open.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Histology of the mid-intestine.</b>—The walls of the stomach are composed
of an internal epithelium, a layer of connective tissue, with two
muscular layers, the inner of which is formed of unstriated circular
muscular fibres, and the outer of striated longitudinal muscular
fibres.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cockroach short processes are given off from the free ends of
the epithelial cells, as in the intestine of many mammals and other
animals. “Between the cells a reticulum is often to be seen, especially
where the cells have burst; it extends between and among all the
elements of the mucous lining, and probably serves, like the very
similar structure met with in mammalian intestines, to absorb and
conduct some of the products of digestion.” (Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Gehuchten shows that the epithelial lining of the mesenteron
(chylific stomach) of the dipterous larva Ptychoptera is composed of
two kinds of cells, <i>i.e.</i> secreting or glandular cells and absorbent
cells, the former situated at each end of the stomach, and the
absorbent<a id='t316'></a> cells occupying the middle region. The part played by
these cells in digestion will be treated of beyond in the section on
digestion. (See p. 327.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The hind-intestine.</b>—In many insects this is divided into the
ileum, or short intestine, and the long intestine. The limit between
the intestine and stomach is externally determined by the origin of
the urinary tubes, which are outgrowths of the anterior end of the
proctodæum. Like the fore-intestine the hind-intestine is lined with
a thick muscular layer, and, as Gehuchten states, the passage from
the epithelial lining of the stomach (mid-intestine) to the muscular
lining of the intestine is abrupt.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Large intestine.</b>—In Ptychoptera, as described by Gehuchten,
there are no precise limits between the small and large intestine;
the epithelium of the large intestine has a special character, and its
constituents present a close resemblance to the absorbed cells of the
chylific stomach, being like them large and polygonal. The muscular
layer is not continuous, and is formed of longitudinal and circular
fibres, the latter being the larger.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span><b>The ileum</b>—Though in most insects slender, and therefore called
the small intestine, the ileum is in locusts (Fig. 298) and grasshoppers
(Anabrus, Fig. 299) as thick as the stomach. In many carnivorous
beetles (Dyticus, Fig. 320, <i>il</i>, and Necrophorus) it is very
long, but rather slender and short in the Carabidæ and Cicindelidæ,
as well as those insects whose food is liquid, such as Diptera. In
the Lepidoptera it varies in length, being in Sphinx quite long and
bent into seven folds (Fig. 309), while it is very short in the Psocidæ,
Chrysomelidæ, and Tenthredinidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the locust the ileum is traversed by six longitudinal folds with
intervening furrows; outside of each furrow is a longitudinal muscular
band. Seen from the inner surface the epithelium has an unusual
character, the cells in the middle of each of the flat folds being quite
large, polygonal in outline, while towards the furrows the cells become
very much smaller. The walls are double when seen in transverse
section, the inner layer consisting of epithelial cells resting on
connective tissue, the outer layer formed of circular muscles. The
cuticula is thin, but probably chitinous; it resembles that on the
gastro-ileal folds, except that there are no spinules, but unlike
the cuticula of the stomach it extends equally over the folds and the
furrows. (Minot.) In the cockroach the junction of the small intestine
with the colon is abrupt, a well-developed annular fold
assuming the nature of a circular valve. (Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The gastro-ileal folds.</b>—In the locust the intestine is separated
from the chylific stomach by what Minot calls “the gastro-ileal
folds,” which form a peculiar valve. The urinary vessels open just
underneath and in front of this valve. In Melanoplus, and probably
in the entire family of Acrydiidæ, they are indicated as “dark spots,
round in front and lying at the anterior end of the ileum so as to
form a ring around the interior of the intestine.” They are 12 in
number, and all alike. They are pigmented and round in front
where they are broadest and stand up highest; they narrow down
backwards, the pigment disappears, and they gradually fade out into
the ileal folds. Directly beneath them, and just at the posterior end
of the stomach, there is a strong band of circular striated muscular
fibres. The epithelium of these folds is covered with minute conical
spines, which are generally, but not always, wanting between the
folds. (Minot.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The colon.</b>—This section of the intestine (Fig. 319) is sometimes
regarded as a part of the rectum. In the locust the six longitudinal
folds of the ileum are continued into the colon, but their surface,
instead of being smooth as in the ileum, is thrown up into numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>irregular curved and zigzag secondary folds. The cells of the epithelium
are of uniform size, and the layer is covered by a highly
refringent cuticula without spines; and,
like that in the ileum, it rests on a layer
of connective tissue, beyond which follows
(1) an internal coat of longitudinal, and
(2) an external coat of circular striated
muscular fibres. (Minot.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In butterflies (<i>Pontia brassicæ</i>), in <i>Sphinx
ligustri</i>, and probably in most Lepidoptera
the colon is distinct from the rectum, and is
anteriorly developed into a very large more
or less pyriform or bladder-like cæcum
(Figs. 309, 310), which in certain Coleoptera
(Dyticus, Fig. 320, <i>d</i>; Silpha, Necrophorus,
etc.) is of remarkable length and shape;
it also occurs in Nepidæ (Fig. 327). In
the cockroach a lateral cæcum “is occasionally,
but not constantly, present towards its
rectal end,” and a constriction divides the
colon from the rectum. (Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The rectum.</b>—The terminal section of
the hind-gut varies in length and size, but
is usually larger than the colon, and with
thick, muscular walls. In Lepidoptera it
is narrow and short.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rectum is remarkable for containing
structures called rectal glands (Fig.
298). Chun describes those of <i>Locusta
viridissima</i> as six flat folds, formed by a
high columnar epithelium and a distinct
cuticula; there is a coat of circular bands
corresponding to the furrows between the
glands. Minot states that this description
is applicable to the locusts (Acrydiidæ) he
has investigated, the only difference being
in the structural details of the single
layers. He claims that the rectal folds
“do not offer the least appearance of
glandular structure,” neither is their function
an absorbent one, as Chun supposed. From their structure and
position Fernald regards the rectal glands of Passalus as acting like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>a valve, serving to retain the food in the absorptive portions of the
digestive tract till all nutriment is extracted.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The epithelial folds of the larvæ of dragon-flies serve as organs of
respiration, the water being admitted into this cavity, and when
forcibly expelled serving to propel the creature forward. Paired and
single anal glands (repugnatorial) enter the rectum of certain Coleoptera
(Figs. 302, <i>l</i>; 317, <i>s</i>; 320, <i>e</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The vent (anus).</b>—The external opening of the rectum is situated
in the end of the body, in the vestigial 10th or 11th abdominal segment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and is more or less eversible. It is protected above in caterpillars,
and other insects with 10 free abdominal segments, by the
suranal plate. It is bounded on the sides by the paranal lobes, while
beneath is the infra-anal lobe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anus is wanting in certain insects, and where this is the case
the hind-gut, owing to a retention of the embryonic condition, is
usually separated from the mid-intestine. (See p. 300.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Some remarkable features of the digestive canal in hemipterous insects are
noteworthy. In the Coccidæ, according to Mark, the anterior end of the long
mid-intestine forms, with the hinder end of the œsophagus,
a small loop, whose posterior end is firmly
grown to the wall of the rectum, and forms a cup-like
invagination of the latter. Then the rest of the
tube-like stomach turns sidewise and forms a large
loop, which turns back on itself and occupies a large
part of the body-cavity. This loop receives on the
anterior end, near the œsophagus, the two urinary
vessels, and forms just below the opening into the
rectum a short cæcum.</p>

<p class='c013'>In other homopterous genera (Psyllidæ and some
Cicadidæ) Witlaczil describes nearly the same peculiarity,
the mid-gut and part of the intestine forming
a loop growing together for a certain distance and
winding round each other (Fig. 321).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Histology of the digestive canal.</b>—In all the
divisions of the digestive canal of insects the
succession of the cellular layers composing
it is the same: 1st, a cuticula; 2d, an epithelium;
3d, connective tissue; 4th, muscular
tissue. In the locust, the first division of the
canal (fore-gut), there are two muscular coats,
an internal longitudinal and an external circular
coat; the fibres are all striated. The
lining epithelium is not much developed, but
forms a thick, hard, and refringent cuticula, which is thrown up
into spiny ridges. In the second division (mid-gut, “stomach”) the
epithelium is composed of very high columnar cells, which make up
the greater part of the thickness of the walls, while the cuticula
is very delicate, slightly refringent, with no ridges, and is probably
not chitinous; the fibres of the muscular coats are not striated,
while this division is also distinguished by the presence of glandular
follicles and folds. The stomach and the cæcal appendages have
all these peculiarities in common, while no other part of the canal is
thus characterized.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>The third division (intestine and rectum) is composed of an epithelium,
the cells of which are intermediate in size between those of the
fore and mid gut. The cells are often pigmented, and they are
covered by a much thicker cuticula than that of the stomach, but
which is not so thick and hard as that of the œsophagus and proventriculus.
The very refringent cuticula is not thrown up into
ridges, though in some parts it is covered with delicate conical
spines, which are very short. “The epithelium and underlying connective
tissue (<i>tunica propria</i>) are thrown up into six folds, which
run longitudinally, being regular in the ileum and rectum (as the
rectal glands), but very irregular in the colon. Outside the depression
between each two neighboring folds there is a longitudinal
muscular band, these making six bands. This peculiar disposition
of the longitudinal muscles does not occur in any other part of the
canal; it is, therefore, especially characteristic of the third division.”

  <h4 class='c011'><i>b</i>. Digestion in insects</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>For the most complete and reliable investigation of the process of
digestion, we are indebted to Plateau, whose results we give, besides
the conclusions of later authors:</p>

<p class='c007'>In mandibulate or biting insects, the food is conducted through
the œsophagus by means of the muscular coating of this part of the
digestive canal. Suctorial insects draw in their liquid food by the
contractions followed by the dilatations of the mid-intestine (chylific
stomach). Dragon-flies, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera swallow some
air with their food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the salivary glands are present, the neutral alkaline fluid
secreted by them has the same property as the salivary fluid of
vertebrates of rapidly transforming starchy foods into soluble and
assimilable glucose. In such forms as have no salivary glands,
their place is almost always supplied by an epithelial lining of the
œsophagus, or, as in the Hydrophilidæ, a fluid is secreted which has
the same function as the true salivary fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nagel states that the saliva of the larva of Dyticus is powerfully
digestive, and has a marked poisonous action, killing other insects,
and even tadpoles of twice the size of the attacking larva, very
rapidly. The larvæ not only suck the blood of their victims, but
absorb the proteid substances. Drops of salivary juice seem to
paralyze the victim, and to ferment the proteids. The secretion is
neutral, the digestion tryptic. Similar extra-oral digestion seems to
occur in larvæ of ant-lions, etc. (Biol. Centralbl., xvi, 1896, pp. 51–57,
103–112; Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc., 1896, p. 184.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In carnivorous insects and in Orthoptera, the œsophagus dilates
into a crop (ingluvies) ended by a narrow, valvular apparatus (or
gizzard of authors). The food, more or less divided by the jaws,
accumulates in the crop, which is very distensible; and, when the
food is penetrated by the neutral or alkaline liquid, there undergoes
an evident digestive action resulting, in carnivorous insects, in the
transformation of albuminoid substances into soluble and assimilable
matter analogous to peptones, and, in herbivorous insects, an abundant
production of sugar from starch. This digestion in the crop, a
food-reservoir, is very slow, and, until it is ended, the rest of the
digestive canal remains empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any decided acidity found in the crop is due to the injection of
acid food; but a very faint acidity may occur, which results from
the presence in the crop of a fluid secreted by the cæcal diverticula
of the mesenteron.” (Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>When digestion in the crop is accomplished, the matters are subjected
to an energetic pressure of the walls through peristaltic contractions,
and then, guided by the furrows and chitinous teeth, pass
along or gradually filter through the valvular apparatus or proventriculus,
whose function is that of a strainer.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the “chyle-stomach” (mesenteron) of Orthoptera
are glandular cæca which secrete a feebly acid fluid. This fluid
emulsifies fats, and converts albuminoids into peptones. It passes
forwards into the crop, and there acts upon the food.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mesenteron (mid-intestine) the food is acted upon by an
alkaline or neutral fluid, never acid, either secreted, as in Orthoptera,
by local special glands, or by a multitude of minute glandular
cæca, as in many Coleoptera, or by a simple epithelial layer. It has
no analogy with the gastric juices of vertebrates; its function differs
in insects of different groups; in carnivorous Coleoptera it actively
emulsionizes greasy matters; in the Hydrophilidæ it continues the
process of transformation of starch into glucose, begun in the œsophagus.
In the Scarabæidæ, it also produces glucose, but this action
is local, not occurring elsewhere; in caterpillars, it causes a production
of glucose, and transforms the albuminoids into soluble and
assimilable bodies analogous to peptones, and also emulsionizes
greasy matters. Finally, in the herbivorous Orthoptera there
does not seem to be any formation of sugar in the stomach itself,
the production of glucose being confined to the crop (jabot).</p>

<p class='c007'>When digestion in the crop is finished, the proventriculus relaxes,
and the contents of the crop, now in a semi-fluid condition, guided
by the furrows and teeth, passes into the mesenteron, which is without
a chitinous lining, and is thus fitted for absorption.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contents of the mid-intestine (chylific stomach) then slowly
and gradually pass into the intestine, the first anterior portion of
which, usually long and slender, is the seat of an active absorption.
The epithelial lining observed in certain insects seems, however, to
indicate that secondary digestion takes place in this section. The
reaction of the contents is neutral or alkaline.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second and larger division of the intestine only acts as a
stercoral reservoir. (The voluminous cæcum occurring in Dyticidæ,
Nepa, and Ranatra, whether full or empty, never contains gas,
and it is not, as some have supposed, a swimming-bladder.) The
liquid product secreted by the Malpighian tubes accumulates in this
division, and, under certain circumstances, very large calculi are
often formed. In his subsequent paper on the digestion of the cockroach,
Plateau states that in the intestine are united the residue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>the work of digestion and the secretion of the urinary or Malpighian
tubes, this secretion being purely urinary.</p>

<p class='c007'>These organs are exclusively depuratory and urinary, freeing the
body from waste products of the organic elements. The liquid they
secrete contains urea (?), uric acid and abundant urates, hippuric
acid (?), chloride of sodium, phosphates, carbonate of lime, oxalate
of lime in quantity, leucine, and coloring-matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The products of the rectal or anal glands vary much in different
groups, but they take no part in digestion, nor are they depuratory
in their nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insects have nothing resembling chylific substances.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c012'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The products
of digestion, dissolved salts, peptones, sugar in solution, emulsionized
greasy matters, pass through the relatively delicate walls
of the digestive canal by osmose, and mingle outside of the canal
with the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever substances remain undigested are expelled with the
excrements; such are the chitin of the integuments of insects,
vegetable cellulose, and chlorophyll, which is detected by the
microspectroscope all along the digestive canal of phytophagous
insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his experiments in feeding the larvæ of Musca with lacmus,
Kowalevsky found that the œsophagus, food-reservoir, and proventriculus,
with its cæcal appendages, always remained blue, and had
an alkaline reaction; the mid-intestine, also, in its anterior portion,
remained blue, but a portion of its posterior half became deep red,
and also exhibited a strong reaction. The hind-intestine, however,
always remained blue, and also had an alkaline reaction. (Biol.
Centralbl., ix, 1889, p. 46.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The mechanism of secretion.</b>—Gehuchten describes the process of
secretion in insects, the following extract being taken from his
researches on the digestive apparatus of the larva of Ptychoptera.
The products of secretion poured into the alimentary canal are more
or less fluid; for this reason, it is impossible to say when an epithelial
cell at rest contains these products. For the secreting nature
of these cells is only apparent at the moment when they are ready
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>for excretion; then the cellular membrane swells out, and a part of
the protoplasmic body projects into the intestinal cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before going farther, the terms <i>secretion</i> and <i>excretion</i> should, he
says, be defined. With Ranvier, he believes that the elaboration in
the protoplasm of a definite fluid substance is, <i>par excellence</i>, the
secretory act, while the removal of this substance is the act of
excretion.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_345.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 322.</span>—Different phases of the mechanism of secretion and of excretion.—After Gehuchten.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A glandular cell of the chylific stomach, when at rest, is always
furnished with a striated “platform,” or flat surface, or face, on the
side facing the cavity of the stomach, and the free edge of the platform,
or plateau, is provided with filaments projecting into the
digestive cavity (Fig. 322, <i>f</i>). These glandular cells, when active,
differ much in appearance. In a great number, the platform (plateau)
has disappeared, and is replaced by a simple, regular membrane.
During the process of secretion, a finely granular mass, in
direct continuity with the protoplasm, swells, and raises the membrane
over the entire breadth of the cell, causing it to project into
the intestinal cavity (Fig. 322, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>). These vesicles, or drops of
the secretion, whether free or still attached by a web to the cells,
are clear and transparent in the living insect, but granular in the
portions of the digestive canal fixed for cutting into sections. Gehuchten
then asks: “How does a cell gorged with the products of
secretion empty itself?” Both Ranvier and also Heidenhain believe
that one and the same glandular cell may secrete and excrete
several times without undergoing destruction, but their researches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>made on salivary glands have not answered the question. Gehuchten
explains the process thus: when the epithelial cell begins to secrete,
the clear fluid elaborated in the protoplasm of the cell increases the
intracellular tension, until, finally, the fluid breaks through certain
weak places in the swollen basal membrane of the platform, and
then easily passes through the closely crowded filaments, and projects
out into the intestinal cavity as a pear-shaped vesicle of a
liquid rich in albumens at first attached to the free face of the cell,
but finally becoming free, as at Fig. 322, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the elaboration of the substance to be secreted is more
active, the mechanism of the secretion is modified. The basal membrane
of the platform may then be raised at several places at once;
instead of a single vesicle projecting into the intestinal cavity, each
cell may present a great number more or less voluminous. If all
remain small and rapidly detach themselves from the glandular cell,
the filaments of the platform are simply separated from each other
at different points of the free face, as in Fig. 322, <i>C</i>. On the other
hand, when the different vesicles of a single cell become larger, the
filaments of the platform are compressed and crowded against each
other in the spaces between the vesicles remaining free, and the
undisturbed portions of the platform appear homogeneous (Fig.
322, <i>D</i>). After the excretion of the secretory products by this
process of strangulation, the cell then assumes the aspect of a glandular
cell at rest, and may begin again to form a new secretion.</p>

<p class='c007'>To sum up: The process of excretion may occur in two ways:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Where the membrane ruptures and the substances secreted are
sent directly out into the digestive cavity. 2. Where the vesicles
become free by strangulation, floating in the glandular or intestinal
cavity, and ending by rupturing and coming into contact with the
neighboring vesicles or with the food.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Absorbent cells.</b>—Besides the glandular or secreting cells in
Ptychoptera, there is between the two regions of the chyle-stomach
lined with these cells a region about a centimetre long composed of
absorbent cells. The absorbent cells are very large, polygonal, and
contain a large nucleus, in which is a striated convoluted chromatic
cord.</p>

<p class='c007'>The food on entering the chyle-stomach is brought into contact
with the products secreted in the proventriculus, in the first part of
the chyle-stomach, and in the tubular glands. These products of
secretion act on the food, extracting from them useful substances
which they render soluble. These substances, after having been
absorbed by the absorbent cells in the middle region of the stomach,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>undergo special modifications, and are transformed into solid products,
which are situated at the bottom of these cells. Afterwards
the alimentary substances freed from a portion of their useful substances
are again placed in contact with the products of secretion in
the distal part of the chylific ventricle, and reach the terminal part
of the intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The products of secretion,” adds Gehuchten, “diverted into the
intestinal canal do not come into immediate contact with the alimentary
substances; they are separated from it by a continuous, structureless,
quite thick membrane (the peritrophic membrane), which
directly envelops the cylinder of food matters, extending from the
orifice of the œsophageal valvule to the end of the intestine.
Between this membrane and the free face of the epithelial lining
there exists a circular space, into which are thrown and accumulate
the excreted substances. The latter then cannot directly mingle
with the aliments; but when they are liquid they undoubtedly pass
through this membrane by osmose, and thus come into contact with
the nutritive substances. It is the same with the products of
absorption. The absorption of soluble products of the intestinal
cavity is not then so simple a phenomenon as it was at first thought
to be, since these products are nowhere brought into immediate contact
with the absorbent cells” (pp. 90, 91).</p>

<p class='c007'>The most recent authority, Cuénot, states that absorption of the
products of digestion takes place entirely in the mid-intestine, and
in its cæca when these are present. The mid-intestine exercises a
selective action on the constituents of the food comparable to the
action of the vertebrate liver.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE GLANDULAR AND EXCRETORY APPENDAGES OF THE DIGESTIVE CANAL</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Into each primary division of the digestive canal open important
glands. The salivary and silk-glands are offshoots of the œsophagus
(stomodæum); the cœcal appendages open into the stomach (mesenteron),
while the urinary tubes grow out in embryonic life from the
primitive intestine (proctodæum), and there are other small glands
which are connected with the end of the hind-intestine.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The salivary glands</h4>

<p class='c016'>We will begin our account of these glands with those of the
Orthoptera, where they are well developed. In the cockroach a
large salivary gland and accompanying reservoir lie on each side
of the œsophagus and crop. The gland is a thin, leaf-like, lobulated
mass, divided into two principal lobes. These open into a common
trunk, which after receiving a branch from a small accessory lobe,
and from the salivary reservoir, unites with its fellow to form the
unpaired salivary duct which opens into the under side of the lingua.
Each salivary reservoir is a large oval sac with transparent walls.
(Miall and Denny, also Figs. 299, <i>sr</i>, and 327.) The ducts and reservoirs
have a chitinous lining, and the ducts are, like the tracheæ, surrounded
by a so-called spiral thread, or by separate, incomplete, hooplike
bands, which serve to keep the duct permanently distended.
In the locust (Fig. 298) the lobules are more scattered, forming
small separate groups of acinose glands. In the embryo of Forficula
Heymons has observed a pair of salivary glands opening on the inner
angle of the mandibles, a second pair opening in the second maxillæ,
while a third pair of glands, whose function is doubtful, is situated
in the hinder part of the head, opening to the right and left on the
chitinous plate (postgula) behind the submentum. In Perla, there
are two pairs segmentally arranged (Fig. 343).</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Here we might refer to a pair of glands regarded by Blanc as the
true salivary glands. They do not appear to be the homologues of
the salivary glands of other insects, though probably functioning
as such. The functional salivary glands of lepidopterous larvæ have
been overlooked by most entomotomists, and the spinning glands
have been, it seems to us, correctly supposed to be modified salivary
glands. Lucas also regards those of case-worms (Trichoptera) as
morphologically salivary glands. Those of the silkworm were figured
by Réaumur (Tom. i, Pl. v, Fig. 1), but not described; while those
of Cossus, which are voluminous, were regarded by Lyonet as
“<i>vaisseaux dissolvans</i>.” Dr. Auzoux (1849), in his celebrated model
of the silkworm, represented them accurately, while Cornalia briefly
described them as opening into the mouth. The first satisfactory
description is that of Blanc
(1891), who states that in the
silkworm “the two salivary
glands” are small, flexuous,
yellow tubes, which occupy a
variable position on the sides
of the œsophagus (Fig. 323).
The glandular portion passes
into the head, ending at the
level of the adductor plate of
the mandibles (Fig. 324, <i>o</i>),
and entering the buccal cavity
at the base of the mandible,
as seen in Fig. 323. It is
plain, when we recognize the
direct homology of the silk-glands
of the caterpillars with
the salivary glands of other
insects, and of the spinneret
with the hypopharynx, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>these so-called “salivary glands” in lepidopterous larvæ are different
structures. They are probably modified coxal glands, belonging to
the mandibular segment.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The polygonal epithelial cells of these glands contain branched nuclei, recalling
those of the spinning-glands. In those caterpillars which feed on leaves, the
salivary glands are slightly developed, but in such as
bore into and eat wood, as the Cossidæ, the glands are,
as figured by Lyonet, very large, forming two sausage-shaped
bodies passing back to the beginning of the mid-intestine,
each ending in a long convoluted filament.
The salivary glands of the imago are very long and convoluted
(Fig. 310, <i>sd</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Panorpidæ these glands differ in the sexes, the
males having three pairs of very long tortuous tubes,
while, in the females, they are reduced to two indistinct
vesicles. (Siebold.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Diptera in general there are two pairs,
one situated in the beak, the other in the thorax.
In the larvæ there is a single pair (Fig. 341).
Kraepelin describes a third pair in the Muscidæ
at the point of transition from the fulcrum to
the œsophagus, but Knüppel has apparently
found only what may be fat cells at this point,
so that the supposed presence of a third pair in
Diptera needs confirmation. In the Psocidæ
there are two salivary glands, of simple tubular
shape (Fig. 325).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Nepidæ the salivary glands are four
in number, and of conglomerate structure, two
being long and extending back into the beginning
of the abdomen, while the other two are
about one-fourth as long. (Figs. 327, 328.) In
Cicada, besides a pair of simple tortuous tubes,
there is in the head another pair of glands,
each composed of two tufts of short lobes,
situated one behind the other. (Dufour.) In
many Hemiptera (Pyrrhocoris, Capsus, etc.)
there is but a single pair, each gland consisting
of four lobes; in the Coccidæ each gland is
divided into two lobes (Fig. 326); in the Aphidæ, according to Witlaczil,
they consist of two lobes grown together. In the Psyllidæ
they are said to be absent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i> the saliva is forced through a salivary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>passage out of the duct and into the mouth by a pumping apparatus
furnished with special muscles. (Krassilstschik.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Odonata acinose glands are present in the imago, but not
in the nymph until in its last stage, Poletaiew accounting for
their absence in the earlier stages by the fact that the larva swallows
more or less water while taking its food.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Coleoptera, as we have observed in Anopthalmus, there
are three pairs of salivary glands (Fig. 74). In the Blapsidæ these
glands consist of many ramifying tubes united on each side of the
œsophagus into a single duct; in others they are but slightly
developed, while in still others they are wanting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The salivary glands are most highly differentiated in the Hymenoptera,
and especially in the bees (Bombus and Apis), where Schiemenz
found not less than five systems of glands (Fig. 329; also 87),
of which four systems are paired. One pair of these glands lies in
the tongue, three in the head, and one in the thorax.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>System I is situated in the head, and consists of unicellular glands; the duct
from each cell leads into a common, strongly chitinized duct, opening into the
gullet.</p>

<p class='c013'>System II, composed of acinose glands, lies also in the head; its duct is
united with that of System III, situated in the thorax. (Fig. 329, <span class='small'>2</span>, <span class='small'>3</span>.)</p>

<p class='c013'>System IV is situated at the base of the upper surface of the mandibles, and
forms a delicate sac lined within with glandular cells; its duct opens at the insertion
of the mandibles.</p>

<p class='c013'>System V lies in the beak, and is a single gland consisting of unicellular
glands; it opens into the common opening of Systems II and III. This system
is wanting in the honey-bee, but occurs in Bombus and other genera.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all the five systems there constantly occur three cellular layers: the intima,
epithelial, and propria. As regards their origin Schiemenz states that Systems I
and IV are new structures, that System III arises in part, and Systems II and
V wholly, from the silk-glands of the
larva. As the glands differ much in
the sexes, and in different species
and genera, Schiemenz believes that
their function is very manifold.</p>

<p class='c013'>In addition to those previously discovered
by Schiementz, Bordas has
detected two additional pairs of salivary
glands in the worker and male
honey-bee, <i>i.e.</i> the internal mandibular
and sublingual glands, so that in Apis
there are in all six pairs, and apparently
one unpaired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delicate chitinous external layer of the gland is perforated
by many very fine pores through which the salivary fluid secreted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>by the epithelial cells passes into the salivary duct. The glands
are externally bathed by the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many insects, including lepidopterous larvæ, the single median
opening of the salivary duct is converted into a spraying apparatus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the adult Lepidoptera, according to Kirbach:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Its lower half forms a thick chitinous gutter, with a concave cover above,
in which the similarly shaped upper half lies encased, so that between the
two only a small semicircular opening remains. Powerful muscles extend from
the cover to the lower side and to the two ridges of the bottom plate; through
their contraction the upper channel is elevated, and presses out of the hinder
part of the ducts into the space thus formed a great quantity of the saliva,
which by allowing the contraction of the cover-muscle through the crevice-like
opening, which is situated in the lower edge of the mouth-opening, becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>squeezed out in order either to mix with the fluid where the 2d maxillæ fuse,
passing up into the canal in the proboscis, or to penetrate into and thus dilute
the semi-fluid or solid substances taken, into the proboscis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The morphology and general relations of the salivary glands have been sketched
out by Hatschek, Patten, and by Lucas, from observations on those of the case-worms
or larval Trichoptera.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Patten states that the spinning-glands in Neophylax are formed by a pair of
ectodermal invaginations on the ventral side of the embryo, between the base
of the 2d maxillæ and the nervous cord. They
increase rapidly in length, and “they also unite
to form a common duct, which opens at the end
of the upper lip.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The salivary glands in the same insect are
“formed by invagination of the ectoderm on the
inner sides of the mandibles, in the same manner
as are the spinning glands.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lucas has shown that in trichopterous larvæ
(Anabolia) there are three pairs of salivary
glands in the head, which are serially arranged.
The first pair belong to the mandibular, the
second pair to the 1st maxillary, and the third
pair, or spinning glands, to the 2d maxillary
segment. The first or mandibular glands open
into the mouth at the base of the mandibles
directly behind the dorsal condyle. The second
pair open between the 1st and 2d maxillæ; at the
base of the latter, near the ventral condyle of
the mandibles. The third pair open into the
hypopharynx, which is modified to form the
spinneret. Lucas agrees with Korschelt in
regarding them as modified coxal glands, Schiemenz
having previously regarded the headglands
of the imago of the bee as belonging to
the segments bearing the three pairs of buccal
appendages, so that each segment originally
contained a pair of glands. It is thus proven
that the silk-glands are modified salivary glands
adapted to the needs of spinning larvæ, and
indeed in the imago the sericteries revert to their
primitive shape and use as salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c013'>The serial arrangement of the salivary glands in the Hymenoptera, where the
number varies from five to ten pairs, is clearly proved by Bordas. He has
detected five more pairs than were previously known, and names the whole series
as follows:—1, the thoracic salivary glands, which are larger than the others,
and nine other pairs, which are all contained in the head as follows: 2, postcerebral;
3, supracerebral; 4, lateropharyngeal; 5, mandibular; 6, internomandibular,
situated on the inner side of the base of mandible; 7, sublingual;
8, lingual (these and 1 to 7 common to all Hymenoptera); 9, paraglossal (in
Vespidæ); 10, maxillary (very distinct in most wasps). These glands do not
all occur in the same species, being more or less atrophied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bordas further shows the segmental arrangement of the cephalic glands by
stating that the supracerebral glands correspond to the antennal segment, the
sublingual glands to the labial, the mandibular glands (external and internal)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>to the mandibular segment, the maxillary glands to the 1st maxillary segment,
the lingual glands to the 2d maxillary segment, while the thoracic and postcerebral
salivary glands, he thinks, correspond to the ocular segment, a view
with which we are indisposed to agree, although conceding that each of the six
segments of the head has in it at least one pair of salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Functions of the different salivary glands in Hymenoptera.</b>—The secretion
of the thoracic glands is feebly alkaline. The postcerebral salivary glands, considered
by Ramdohr to be organs of smell, secrete, like the preceding, a distinctively
alkaline fluid, which mingles with the products of the thoracic glands.
The supracerebral glands, also equally well developed in all Hymenoptera,
though much atrophied in the females and especially the males of <i>Apis mellifica</i>,
also in the Vespinæ and Polistinæ, secrete an abundant, feebly acid liquid,
which is actively concerned in digestion.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the mandibular glands, which Wolf supposed to be olfactory organs,
their acid secretion, though smelling strongly, acts energetically on the food as
soon as introduced into the mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sublingual glands, atrophied in most Apidæ, but relatively voluminous in
Sphegidæ, Vespinæ, Polistinæ, Crabronidæ, etc., empty their secretion into a
small prebuccal excavation, where accumulate vegetable and earthy matters
collected by the tongue, and the saliva secreted by these glands, acts upon them
before they pass into the pharynx. The lingual glands secrete a thick, sticky
liquid, which causes foreign bodies to adhere to the tongue, and also agglutinates
alimentary substances. The uses of the other glands, maxillary and paraglossal,
are from their minuteness undetermined. (Bordas.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The silk or spinning glands, and the spinning apparatus</h4>

<p class='c016'>The larvæ of certain insects, chiefly those of the Lepidoptera,
possess a pair of silk or spinning glands (sericteries) which unite to
form a single duct opening in the upper lip at the end of the lingua,
which is modified to form the spinneret. (See pp. 71, 75.) All
caterpillars possess them, and they are best developed in the silkworms,
which spin the most complete cocoon. Silk-glands also
occur in the larvæ of the Tenthredinidæ, in the case-worms or larval
Trichoptera, also in certain chrysomelid beetles (Donacia, Hæmonia),
and in a weevil (Hypera). In a common caddis-worm (Limnophilus)
the glands are of a beautiful pale violet-blue tint, and two
and a half times as long as the larva itself; viz. the body is 20 mm.
and the glands 55 mm. in length.</p>

<p class='c007'>In caterpillars the glands are of tubular shape, shining white, and
much like the ordinary simple tubular salivary glands of the imago.
When only slightly longer than the body they are twice folded, the
folds parallel and situated partly beneath and partly on the side of
the digestive canal; not usually, when folded in their natural position,
extending much behind the end of the stomach; but in the
silkworms they are so long and folded as to envelop the hinder part
of the canal. In geometrid caterpillars the glands when stretched
out only reach slightly beyond the end of the body; in Datana they
are half again as long as the body. Helm thus gives their relative
length in certain Eurasian caterpillars, and we add that of <i>Telea
polyphemus</i>:—</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'>Thus in Telea the silk-glands are about 18.50 inches in length,
being about seven times as long as the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the most complete accounts of the spinning glands of Lepidoptera
and their mechanism we are indebted to Helm and to Blanc,
and for that of the Trichoptera to Gilson.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The unpaired portion, or spinning apparatus (<i>filière</i> of Lyonet), is
divided into two portions; the hinder half being the “thread-press,”
the anterior division the “directing tubes.” The silk material,
stored up in the thickest portion of the glands, passes into the
thread-press (Fig. 334, <i>A</i>), which is provided with muscles which
force the two double ribbon-like threads through the directing tube,
as wire is made by molten iron being driven through an iron plate
perforated with fine holes. The entire spinning apparatus, or <i>filator</i>,
as we may call it, is situated in the tubular spinneret. The opening
of the spinneret is directed anteriorly, and the anterior end of the
directing tube passes directly into this opening so that the directing
tube may be regarded as an invagination of the lingua.</p>

<p class='c007'>The silk thread which issues from the mouth of the spinneret is,
as Leeuwenhoek discovered, a double ribbon-like band, as may be
seen in examining the silk of any cocoon.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The process of spinning.</b>—Since the appearance of Helm’s account,
Gilson, and also Blanc, have added to our knowledge of the way in
which the silk is spun and of the mechanism of the process. Gilson
has arrived, in regard to the function of the press or filator, at the
following conclusions: 1, the press regulates the thread, it compresses
it, gives it its flattened shape; 2, it regulates the layer of
gum<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c012'><sup>[52]</sup></a> (grès) which surrounds the thread; 3, it may render the thread
immovable by compressing it as if held by pincers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process of spinning in the silkworm, says Blanc, comprises all
the phenomena by which the mass of silk contained in the reservoir
is transformed into the silk fluid of which the cocoon is spun. The
excretory canals each contain a cylindrical thread of silk having a
mean diameter of 0.2&thinsp;mm. and surrounded by a layer of gum (<i>grès</i>)
which in the fresh living organ exactly fills the annular space situated
between the fibroin cylinder and the wall. Arrived within the
common duct, the two threads receive the secretion of Filippi’s gland,
where the silken fluid is formed, but has not yet assumed its definite
external characters. The two threads press through the common
canal and arrive at the infundibulum (Fig. 334, <i>c</i>) of the press, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the bottom of which is situated the orifice of the spinning canal,
almost completely divided into two by the sharp edge of the rachis
(Figs. 334, <i>a</i>, 335, <i>l</i>). The threads each pass into one of the two
grooves, and the layer of gum (<i>grès</i>) fills the rest of the canal of the
press or filator.</p>

<p class='c007'>The silken substance is then pressed
by the more or less powerful contractions
of the muscles of the filator, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>that the passage of the threads is facilitated. If the muscles totally
contract, the spinning canal is opened wide, the threads pass easily
upwards and assume the form of a triangular prism (Fig. 336).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If this contraction diminishes, the chitinous wall of the spinneret
comes together, owing to its elasticity; the ceiling of the canal approaches
the floor; the cavity tends to take the form of a semicircular
slit, and the threads are compressed, flattened.
As each mass or thread of silk is much
more voluminous than the canal, except when
the latter is extremely dilated, it follows that
the two threads are always compressed, or
squeezed together, and that each of them is
compelled to mould itself in the groove it
occupies and to take its shape. Hence the
variations in the appearance of the two masses
or divided portions of silk, which as stated
present all grades between the form of an
isosceles-triangular prism and that of a nearly
flat ribbon; but this last case is quite rare.
The use of the spinneret, then, is to compress
the thread and to change its form more or
less considerably, at the same time as it diminishes
its diameter.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, this constant compression of the
thread as it passes through the press keeps
it in a certain state of
tension so as to allow the
caterpillar while spinning
to firmly hold its thread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, when the worm
suspends the contraction
of its spinning muscles,
the press flattens, vigorously
compresses the
thread, and arrests its motion, in such a way that if there was a
strain on the silken fluid (<i>bave</i>), it would break rather than oblige
the caterpillar to let go any more of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The press does not act directly on the silken thread, but through
the gummy layer (<i>grès</i>) which transmits over the whole surface of the
silken fluid (<i>brin</i>) the pressure exerted on it. After having overcome
this difficult passage, the silk thread has acquired its definite form;
it rapidly passes out of the spinneret.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span><b>How the thread is drawn out.</b>—Having seen, says Blanc, how the
two masses of silk (<i>brins</i>), in passing through the spinning apparatus
(or press), join each other, constituting the frothy silken fluid,
thus becoming modified in form, it remains to examine the way in
which the thread is drawn out of the spinneret. If we examine a
caterpillar while spinning, it will be seen that in moving its head it
draws on the frothy mass of silk fixed to the web of the cocoon.
This traction certainly aids very much the exit of the thread, but it
is not the only cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The silk, Blanc affirms, is pushed out by a force <i>a tergo</i>, developed
by different agents, such as the pressure of the distended cuticle or
the silky mass contained in the reservoir, as seen in the section of a
worm which has spun its cocoon. But if we consider a caterpillar
before it has begun to spin, it is difficult to explain the mechanism
of spinning. As Blanc has often observed, in making sections of
the heads of silkworms, two cases arise. Sometimes the worm has
already spun a little, and a certain length of the frothy silk (<i>bave</i>)
issues from the orifice of the spinneret, where it forms a small
twisted bundle. At other times the worm has not spun since its
last moult or the frothy mass of silk has broken within the head,
and we find the end in the common tube. In the first of these two
cases, the worm, dilating its press, is able by a general contraction
to discharge a little of the gritty material (<i>grès</i>) which lines the ball
of silk hanging at the end of the spinneret. It can also reject a
certain quantity of the secretion of Filippi’s glands and thus soften
the gritty substance. The little plug of silk can then adhere to the
body with which it comes in contact.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same case it is necessary that the two bits or portions of
silk traverse the press, and this normally has a calibre less than
their diameter. The worm should then distend the spinning tube
as much as is practicable, so as to make the openings as large as
possible. It has been stated that the press is, in this condition, at
least as large as the mass of frothy silk. This Blanc believes
(although Gilson thinks otherwise) is pushed by a force <i>a tergo</i>, and
reaches the funnel of the spinning canal; its two bits of silk (<i>brins</i>)
unite there, penetrate into the canal itself, and, owing to successive
impulses produced by the general contractions of the worm, press
through and pass out of the spinneret.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the silkworm is engaged in spinning its cocoon, the spinneret
and press execute very varied movements, determined by the
elevator, depressor, retractor, and protractor muscles of the labium,
as well as those of the press. These movements, originally very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>numerous, may combine among themselves, so that the spinneret
is susceptible of assuming during the process of spinning still more
diverse positions.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Histologically the silk-glands are composed of three layers,—the
outer, or <i>tunica propria</i> (Fig 337); the inner, the <i>tunica intima</i>; the
middle layer being composed of extraordinarily large epithelial cells
which can be seen with the naked eye, and are also remarkable for
the branched shape of the nuclei (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, 337), the branches being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>more or less lobed, and the larger the cells the more numerous are the
branches of the nucleus. Gilson<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> finds that those of Trichoptera,
Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera ordinarily consist of a
small number of cells; and it is
quite common, he says, to find only
two cells in a transverse section
(Fig. 338, <i>A</i>). In the Tenthredinidæ,
however, “the organ still consists
of a tube, the wall of which is
composed of flat cells, but in addition
to that, two series of spheroidal
cells are attached to the sides. Each
of these cells contains a system of
tiny canals running through their
cytoplasm (<i>B</i>, <i>i. d</i>). These cells are the secreting elements; they
continually cast the silk substance into the tube.” A peculiarity
of the <i>tunica intima</i> is its distinct transverse striation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The lining of the
glands and of their common
duct is moulted
when the caterpillar
casts its skin, and this,
as well as the mode of
development, shows that
the glands are invaginations
of the ectoderm.
Gilson finds that the
silk-glands and silk-apparatus
of Trichoptera
are very similar to those
of caterpillars, and that
the silk is formed in the
same way.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Appendages of the silk-gland
(Filippi’s glands).</b>—In
most larvæ there
is either a single or a
pair of secondary glands
which open into the spinning glands near their anterior end. They
are outgrowths of the gland provided with peculiarly modified excretory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>cells or evaginations of the entire glandular epithelium. Those
of <i>Bombyx mori</i> (Fig. 340) are very well developed, and, according to
Blanc, form two whitish, lobulated masses in the labium on each side
of the common duct of the spinning gland. Externally they appear
to be acinose; but their structure, as described by Blanc and by
Gilson, is very peculiar. Helm thinks, with Cornalia, that the
function of these glands is to secrete the adhesive fluid which
unites the silk threads, and also to make the silk more adhesive in
the process of spinning, but Blanc states that this is done before the
thread passes into the common excretory tubes, and he is inclined
to think that the secretion serves to lubricate the spinneret, and
thus to facilitate the passage of the thread. On the other hand, in
certain caterpillars these glands are situated quite far from the
spinning apparatus.</p>

<p class='c013'>The silk-glands in the pupa state undergo a process of degeneration, and
finally completely disappear. They are specific larval organs evolved in adaptation
to the necessity of the insect’s being protected during its pupal life by a
cocoon. (Helm.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Morphologically the silk-glands are by Lang regarded as modified coxal glands,
and homologues of the setiparous parapodial glands of chætopod worms, the
coxal glands of Peripatus, and the spinning glands of spiders.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Scolopendrella, spinning glands are situated in the two last segments of
the body, opening out at the end of the cercopods (Fig. 15, <i>s.gl</i>), and the larvæ
of the true Neuroptera (Chrysopa, Myrmeleon, etc.) which spin cocoons, have
spinning glands opening into the rectum. The silk forming the cocoon of the
ant-lion, as Siebold and the older observers have stated, is secreted by the walls
of the rectal or anal sac. Siebold (Anatomy of the Invertebrates, p. 445) states
that in the larva of Myrmeleon, the silk-apparatus is very remarkable, “for the
rectum itself is changed into a large sac and secretes this substance which escapes
through an articulated spinneret projecting from the opening of the anus”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
(Fig. 307, <i>e</i>). The larvæ of the Mycetophilidæ have spinning glands at the hinder
end of the body, as also the imago of the female of the tineid moth Euplocamus.
(Kennel.) The larvæ of ichneumons, wasps, bees, of Cecidomyia, and other
Diptera, spin silken cocoons, but their glands have not yet been examined.</p>

<p class='c013'>It should also be observed that during the process of pupation the larvæ of
butterflies, of certain flies (Syrphus), and beetles (Coccinellidæ and some Chrysomelidæ)
attach themselves by silk spun from the anus, so that the pupa is suspended
by its tail; such glands are probably homogenetic with the coxal glands.</p>

<p class='c013'>The silk in its fluid or soft state is mucilaginous, and according to Mulder, in
the silkworm consists of the following substances, varying somewhat in their
relative proportions by weight:</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> The cæcal appendages.</h4>

<p class='c016'>These diverticula of the mid-intestine (“stomach”) are appended
to the anterior end, and in the living, transparent larva of Sciara,
which has two large, long, slender cœca (Fig. 341), the partly digested
food may be seen oscillating back and forth from the anterior end
of the stomach into and out of the base of each cæcum. In the Locustidæ
(Anabrus, Fig. 299) and Gryllidæ (Fig. 344, <i>e</i>) there are two large,
short cæca, and in the locusts (Caloptenus) there are six cæca, while
cockroaches have eight. In the Coleoptera (Carabidæ and Dyticidæ)
these large cæca appear to be replaced by very numerous slender,
minute villi or tubules, which arise from the anterior part of the
stomach (Figs. 317, <i>r</i>, also 342).</p>

<p class='c007'>These cæca differ in structure from the stomach, as shown by
Graber, as well as by Plateau and by Minot. The latter states that
a single transverse section of one of the diverticula of the locust
demonstrates at once that its structure is entirely different from
that of the stomach.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Its inner surface is thrown up into longitudinal folds, generally twelve in
number. These folds shine through the outer walls, and are accordingly indicated
in the drawings of Dufour, Graber, and others. The
entire cæcum has an external muscular envelope, outside of
which are a few isolated longitudinal muscular bands. The
folds within are formed mainly by the high cylindrical epithelium
which lines the whole interior of the cavity. Tracheæ
ramify throughout all the layers outside the epithelium.
There are appearances of glandular follicles in the bottom
of the spaces between the folds. (Minot.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Burmeister supposed that these cæca were analogous
to the pancreas, and this view has been
confirmed by Hoppe Seyler, Krukenberg, Plateau,
and others, who claim that the digestive properties
of the fluid secreted in them agrees with the pancreatic
fluid of vertebrates.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The excretory system (urinary or Malpighian tubes)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The excretory matters or waste products of the
blood tissue of worms are carried out of the body
by segmentally arranged tubes called <i>nephridia</i>.
As a rule they arise in the blood sinuses of the body
and open externally through minute openings in the
skin. As there is a pair to each segment (in certain
oligochete worms two or three pairs to a segment),
they are often called segmental organs. In the
annulate worms each segment of the body, even the cephalic or oral
segment, originally contains a pair of these excretory organs. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>vessels may have survived in myriopods and perhaps do exist in
insects as urinary tubes, and also occur in many of the Arachnida,
and thus are characteristic of each important class of land arthropods,
but are either wanting or are very rudimentary or much modified
in the marine classes, notably the Crustacea and Merostomata
(Limulus), where they are represented by the
shell-glands of Copepoda, green glands of the
lobster, and the brick-red glands of Limulus.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the earliest tracheate arthropod, Peripatus,
these tubes are well developed and are highly
characteristic, each segment behind the head
bearing a pair (Fig. 4, <i>so<sub>4</sub></i>-<i>so<sub>9</sub></i>). It has been suggested
by some, but not yet proved, that the
urinary tubes of insects are morphologically the
same as the segmental organs of worms and of
Peripatus; but there are no facts directly supporting
this view, and, as Sograff states, it is a
pure hypothesis and can only be confirmed or
disproved by very detailed researches on the
development of the urinary tubes of myriopods
and of insects. Others regard them as probably
homologous with the tracheæ, since they have a
similar origin. As, however, they arise in the
embryo as outgrowths of the proctodæum they
may have arisen in myriopods and insects independently,
and not be vermian heirlooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in worms and in Peripatus a pair of
these segmental organs occur in each segment, in
insects this serial arrangement is not apparent;
those with a purely excretory function are not
segmentally arranged, with outlets opening
externally, but arise as outgrowths of the hind-intestine
or proctodæum of the embryo, not
being segmentally arranged. The place of their
origin is usually the dividing line between the
mid and hind intestine (Fig. 343, <i>mp</i>); this
applies to Scolopendrella (Fig. 15, <i>urt</i>) as well as to insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The urinary tubes are usually long, slender, blind, tubular glands
varying in number from two to over a hundred, which generally
arise at the constriction between the mid and hind intestine, and
which lie loosely in the cavity of the body, often extending towards
the head, and then ending near the rectum (Figs. 301, 310, <i>vm</i>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>They were first discovered by the Italian anatomist Malpighi, after
whom they were called the Malpighian tubes. While at first
generally regarded as “biliary” tubes, they are now universally
considered to be exclusively excretory organs, corresponding to the
kidneys of the higher animals.</p>

slender hinder part of the mid-intestine,
being widely separated

<p class='c007'>The length varies in different
groups; where they are
few in number (two to four,
six to eight), they are very
long, but where very numerous
they are often short, forming
dense tufts, each tuft connecting
with the intestine by
a common duct (ureter), or,
as in the mole-cricket, the
numerous tubes empty into a
single duct (Fig. 344); in the
locusts (Acrydiidæ), however,
they are arranged in 10 groups,
each group consisting of about
15 tubes, making about 150 in
all; and are much convoluted
and wound irregularly around
the digestive canal, and when
stretched out being about as
long as the entire body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The urinary tubes occur in twos, or in multiples of two, though a
remarkable exception is presented in the dipterous genera Culex and
Psychodes, in which there are five tubes; the young and fully
grown larvæ, as well as the pupa and imago of Culex, having this
number (Fig. 433, <i>mg</i>.)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>In many insects (Pentatoma, Cimex, Velia, Gerris, Haltica, Donacia, and
often in caterpillars), the vessels open into a sort of urinary bladder connecting
with the intestine on one side.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In the larvæ of some insects the blind ends of the tubes are often externally
bound to the rectum, in the silkworms being attached by fine threads to the
intestine, while in some flies (Tipula and Ctenophora),
two vessels may unite to form a loop.
In all larval Cecidomyiæ, the two tubes are united
to form a loop which curves backward, opening
near the vent, the proctodæum being very short.

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>While usually the urinary vessels form simple
tubes, in many species of Lepidoptera and Diptera
they are branched, thus resembling those
of spiders and scorpions. Moreover, in many
Lepidoptera and Diptera (Fig. 308), the tubes
are not simple, but are lobulated, and in some Hemiptera (Pentatoma, Notonecta,
and Tettigonia) are twisted or lace-like. In rare cases there are two kinds
of urinary tubes; in <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, two of them are partly lobulated and
yellow, while the other two are simple and white. Their color in beetles varies,
some being whitish or yellowish; in Geotrupes, Dyticidæ, Hydrophilidæ, etc.,
reddish brown; in Gryllotalpa as well as <i>Locusta viridissima</i>, there are two
different kinds of vessels, differing in contents and in
color (white or yellow), as well as histologically.
(Schindler.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The exterior of the tubes is richly provided with
tracheæ, which often form a web around them, and
the fine branches often seem to attach them to the
intestine. In Acheta they are enveloped by a very delicate,
loose network of muscular fibres. (Schindler.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The urinary tubes consist, according to Schindler,
of at least three cellular layers (Fig. 345):—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. An external, connective, nucleated membrane, the peritoneal membrane.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. A very delicate homogeneous basal membrane, the <i>tunica propria</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. A single layer of large polygonal excretory cells.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. Lining the internal canal a chitinous layer penetrated by pore-canals, the <i>intima</i> often wanting.</p>

<p class='c013'>The secretory cells are usually of the same size,
but in many cases are relatively small; sometimes
four to six or more form the periphery of the canal,
sometimes three or only two. In some insects the
cells are so very large that a single cell forms the
entire periphery. The nuclei in the Lepidoptera
(Papilio, Pontia, Cossus) are large and irregularly
branched.</p>

<p class='c013'>The excretions of the Malpighian vessels, derived from the blood and from
the fat-body, are more or less fluid and granular, sometimes pulpy. From the
cells they pass into the canal, thence into the intestine, and thence out of the
body. How, says Kolbe, the secretion passes into the intestine, whether by the
contraction of the fine fibrillæ of the peritoneal membrane, or by the external
pressure of the other organs, or by the pressure of the secretory matter behind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>is not yet known. Grandis observed in living Hydrophilus that the urinary tubes
moved, without the muscles seeming to show what caused the motion. Moreover,
the cells incessantly changed their form. At a lower temperature such motions
ceased. The tracheæ, ending freely in the cells, did not anastomose. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The different colors of the tubes (white, yellow, red, brown, or green) is due
to the hue of the excretions, and is independent of the color of the blood and of
the urinary substances held in the secreted matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Schindler found that insects of different stages, collected in winter, differed
very much in their urinary secretions, the tubes in the adults being entirely
empty, while in the larvæ they were filled full, so that he concluded that in the
former the process of excretion during the winter hibernation is very slow, but
in the latter very rapid.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the activity of the urinary vessels the following experiments will throw
some light. Tursini fed a Pimelia with fuchsin; its urinary tubes were consequently
colored red. Schindler fed insects with indigo-carmine, which was
excreted by the urinary tubes; Kowalevsky arrived at the same results, which
seems to prove that these vessels are analogous to the kidneys of vertebrates.
Moreover, Schindler injected through the side of the first abdominal segment into
the cavity of the body of a Gryllotalpa a concentrated solution of sodium salt of
indigotin-disulphonic acid. After one or two hours the external portion of the
epithelium of the urinary vessels was stained deep blue, while the inner portion
remained of the normal transparency; the nuclei being for the most part deeply
stained. Between one and two days after, the staining matter had not yet
wholly passed through the central canal, the surface recently stained still appearing
light blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The solid contents of the urinary tubes consist partly of crystals,
which occur singly in the epithelial cells, or form scattered masses
when situated in the central canal. Besides tabular rhombic crystals,
there occur concretions which contain uric acid, and probably
consist of urate of soda, also octahedral crystals of chloride of soda,
and quadro-pyramidal crystals of oxalate of lime. Also acicular
prisms occur; besides chloride of soda, phosphates, carbonate of
lime, oxalate of lime in quantity, leucine, coloring matters, etc.;
while the fluid secretion also contains urea (?), uric acid, and abundant
urates; uric acid crystals were precipitated by the addition of
acetic acid, and by adding hydrochloric acid crystals belonging to
the dimetric system were formed. The often numerous spheroidal
small granules are biurate of soda and biurate of ammonia. Pale,
concentrically banded concretions are leucine pellets.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to Kölliker the contents of the urinary vessels<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a> in general are:
(1) round granules of urate of soda and urate of ammonia; (2) oxalate of lime;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>and (3) pale transparent concretions of leucine. Crystals of taurin are also said
to occur. (Claus’ Zoölogy, p. 531.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Although uric acid is characteristic of the urinary tubes, yet sometimes it is
wanting in them, while uric acid substances in quantity occur in the fat-body or
in the mid-intestine.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the living insect the urinary tubes remove urates from the blood; “the
salts are condensed and crystallized in the epithelial cells, by whose dehiscence
they pass into the central canals of the tubules and thence into the intestine.”
(Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The process of excretion is carried on not only by the urinary tubes, but also,
as Cuénot has recently shown (1896) in Orthoptera, by the pericardial cells and
certain cells of the fat-bodies. In the last-named cells urates are stored throughout
life; the pericardial cells apparently secrete but do not store waste products,
which are finally eliminated by the urinary tubes, the latter constantly eliminating
waste.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Primitive number of tubes.</b>—Wheeler considers the primitive number of
urinary tubules to be six, other authors regarding two pairs as the primary or
typical number; and while Wheeler agrees that the more ancestral tracheate
arthropods had but a single pair, Cholodkowsky supposes the primitive number
in insects themselves to be a single pair. This view is strengthened by the fact
that Scolopendrella has but a single pair (Fig. 15).</p>

<p class='c013'>While Peripatus has no urinary tubes, in Myriopods a single pair arises, as in
insects, from the hind-intestine.</p>

<div  class='figright id011'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When in insects the number of these tubes is few, they are, with rare exceptions,
arranged in pairs, so that Gegenbaur and others have considered this
paired arrangement as the primitive one. When
the tubules are very numerous in the adult, as in
Orthoptera, the embryos and larvæ have a much
smaller number, Wheeler stating that “in no
insect embryo have more than three pairs of these
vessels been found.” We have observed 10
primary tubes in the embryo of Melanopus (Fig.
347), from each of which afterwards arise 15
secondary tubules. In the Termites, only, do the
young forms have more urinary tubes than the
adults.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Campodea there are about 16 urinary tubes
and in Machilis either 12 (Grassi) or 20 (Oudemans);
but in other Thysanura the number is
much less, Lepisma having either four, six, or
eight, according to different authors, and both
Nicoletia and Lepismina having six, opening separately
into the hind-intestine. On the other hand,
these organs have not yet been detected in
Japyx. Whether they exist at all in the Collembola, which are degenerate
forms, is doubtful. The weight of opinion denies their existence, though they
may yet be found existing in a vestigial condition. They are said by Tullberg
and by Sommer to exist in Podura, but are of peculiar shape.</p>

<p class='c013'>Coming now to the winged insects, in what on the whole is perhaps the lowest
or most generalized order, the Dermaptera, the number is over 30, and their
insertions regularly encircle the intestine. (Schindler.) In the most ancient
and generalized family of Orthoptera, the Blattidæ, Schindler detected from
60 to 70 tubes, but in a nymph of Periplaneta not quite 10 mm. in length he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>found from 16 to 18, and in nymphs 4 to 5 mm. long there were only eight vessels;
while Wheeler has found in the embryo of <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i> but four
tubes. In the adult Acrydiidæ there are as many as 150, in the Locustidæ
between 40 and 50, and in the Gryllidæ about 100.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Ephemeridæ with about 40, the Odonata with 50 to 60 tubules, the Perlidæ
with from 50 to 60, are polynephrious; while the Termitidæ and Psocidæ
are oligonephrious, the former having from six to eight and the Psocidæ only
four tubes. So also all the other orders not mentioned, except the Hymenoptera,
have few of these tubes. The Hemiptera, with none in Aphidæ, a single pair
in the Coccidæ, and two in all the rest of the order, have the fewest number.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Neuroptera there are from six to eight, while in a larva, possibly that
of Chauliodes, Wheeler finds the exceptional number of seven.</p>

<p class='c013'>The closely allied order Mecoptera (Panorpidæ), and also the Trichoptera,
agree with the Neuroptera (Sialis) in having six. According to Cholodkowsky
all Lepidoptera have six of these vessels, except Galleria, which has but four.
He finds that in <i>Tinea biselliella</i> (also <i>T. pellionella</i> and <i>Blabophanes rusticella</i>)
the larva has six vessels, which, however, undergo histolysis during pupation,
a single pair arising in their stead. On this account he regards the primitive
number of urinary tubes as two, or a single pair, this return from six vessels in
the larva to two in the imago being considered a case of atavism.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Coleoptera, the number of urinary tubes is from four to six; in what
few embryo beetles have been examined (Doryphora, Melolontha), there are six
vessels, but in the embryo of <i>Dyticus fasciventris</i>, Wheeler has detected only
four, this number being retained in the adult. He thinks that in beetles in
general, a pair of vessels must be “suppressed during post-embryonic development,
presumably in early larval life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In Diptera and Siphonaptera, the number four is very constant, there being,
however, a fifth one in Culex and Psychoda (Fig. 400.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The number of these vessels is very inconstant in the Hymenoptera, varying
from six (Tomognathus, an ant, worker) to 12 (Myrmica), and in Apis reaching
the number of 150.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the embryo of the honey-bee and wall-bee (Chalicodoma), there are only
four; we still lack any knowledge of the number in embryo saw-flies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a tabular view of insects with few urinary tubes
(Oligonephria) and many (Polynephria). It will be seen that the
number has little relation to the classification or phylogeny, insects
so distantly related as the Orthoptera and Hymenoptera being
polynephrious:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Here should be mentioned the singular fact discovered by Koulaguine that in
the larva of Microgaster, the urinary tubes have no connection with the intestine,
but open dorsally on the outside of the body on each side of the anus.
Ratzeburg had stated that the last segment of the body was in the form of a
vesicle. Koulaguine now shows that this vesicle is in reality the end of the intestine
opening upwards; as the result of this dorsal opening of the intestine
the Malpighian vessels open on the sides of the oval vent, and have no connection
with the intestinal canal. Whether this is of morphological import, or is
only a secondary adaptation, Koulaguine does not state, his paper being a preliminary
abstract.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wheeler thus sums up our present knowledge regarding the number
and homologies of the Malpighian or urinary tubes:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. It is very probable that the so-called Malpighian vessels of Crustacea and
Arachnida are not the homologues of the <i>vasa Malpighi</i> of the Eutracheata (insects
and myriopods).</p>

<p class='c013'>2. The Malpighian vessels of the Eutracheata arise as paired diverticula of
the hind-gut and are, therefore, ectodermal.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. In no insect embryo are more than six vessels known to occur; although
frequently only four are developed.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. The number six occurs either during embryonic or post-embryonic life in
members of the following groups: Apterygota, Orthoptera, Corrodentia; Neuroptera,
Panorpata, Trichoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. The number four seems to be typical for the Corrodentia, Thysanoptera,
Aphaniptera, Rhynchota, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. The embryonic number in Dermaptera, Ephemeridea, Plecoptera, and Odonata
has not been ascertained, but will probably be found to be either four or six.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. There is evidence that in at least one case (Melolontha), the tetranephric
is ontogenetically derived from the hexanephric condition by the suppression of
one pair of tubules.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>8. It is probable that the insects which never develop more than four Malpighian
vessels have lost a pair during their phylogeny.</p>

<p class='c013'>9. The post-embryonic increase in the number of Malpighian vessels in some
orders (Orthoptera, Odonata, Hymenoptera) is secondary and has apparently
arisen to supply a demand for greater excreting surface.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>e.</i> Poison-glands</h4>

<p class='c016'>Poison-glands are mainly confined to the stinging Hymenoptera,
<i>i.e.</i> certain ants, and the wasps and bees, but also occur in the mosquito,
while many, if not most bugs, seem to instil a drop of poison
into the punctured wounds they make.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the honey and other bees the poison apparatus consists of two
poison-glands whose secretion passes by a single more or less convoluted
efferential duct into the large poison-sac, and thence by
the excretory duct, which is enlarged at the base of the sting (Figs.
194, 195), out through the sting by the same passage as the eggs.
According to Carlet, the poison apparatus of bees consists of two
kinds of glandular organs, of which one kind secretes a feebly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>alkaline fluid, the other an acid product. The poison is only effective
when both fluids are mixed. The resultant venom is always
acid. The action of this venom upon some animals, as rabbits, frogs,
and certain beetles, is slight; but the domestic fly and the flesh-fly
are immediately killed by it. The inoculation of a fly with the
secretion of one of the glands does not produce death until after a
considerable time, but death follows very quickly if the same fly
is subjected to a second inoculation, this time with the secretion
of the other gland. The alkaline glands are in bees and all poisonous
Hymenoptera strongly developed, but become vestigial in those
forms which sting their prey to serve as food for their larvæ. The
poison which the solitary sand and
wood wasps and Pompilidæ inject
into their victims only paralyzes them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Bordas has found both the alkaline gland (gland of Dufour) and the acid
gland to occur in a hundred species of Hymenoptera, including not only Aculeata,
but also Ichneumonidæ (Fig. 348), Tenthredinidæ, and they may be safely said
to be of general occurrence. The acid gland consists of three parts, the glandular
portion, the reservoir for the poison, and the secretory canal. The alkaline
gland is an irregular tube, with a striated surface and without a reservoir. In
most Hymenoptera there is still a third gland, which is unpaired, granular, rectangular
or lanceolate, with a short filamentous duct which opens beside the
orifice of the alkaline glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poison in ants, wasps, and bees consists of two substances,
<i>i.e.</i> formic acid and a whitish, fatty, bitter residue in the secretion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>of the glands; the corroding active formic acid is the essential part
of the poison. (Will.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In Melipona the sting and poison-glands are aborted; in certain
ants (Formica, Lasius, etc.) the sting is wanting, but the poison-sac
is extraordinarily large.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bordas finds in various species of Ichneumon three kinds of glands opening
into the base of the sting. The first two correspond to the acid (Fig. 348,
<i>G.A</i>) and alkaline (<i>G.A</i>) glands of bees and wasps (Vespidæ, etc.), and the
third (<i>G.ac</i>) is situated between the two lateral muscular bundles which attach
the base of the sting to the last abdominal segment. The poison-reservoir
(Fig. 348, <i>V</i>) is recognized by its yellow color and diaphanous and striated
appearance. It is situated on the left of the hind-intestine, a little in front
of the rectum. The tubular gland (<i>Ga</i>) or alkaline gland of aculeate Hymenoptera
is remarkably large; it is situated on the left side of the body. The
accessory gland (<i>G.A</i>) is elongated, triangular, flat, its duct opening at the
base of the alkaline gland; it is formed of small spherical cells. Bordas has
met with well-developed poison-glands in forty species belonging to the Terebrantia,
including that of Tenthredo, Emphytus, as well as various genera of
Ichneumonidæ, but in all these species the accessory gland was wanting.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Under the name of cephalic glands (Fig. 349), Locy describes
a pair of glands in the head of Nepidæ. The epithelial or secreting
cells are 8–sided (Fig. 350). “When these insects are irritated,” he
says, “a secretion is freely thrown out around the base of the beak,
which produces death very quickly when introduced on a needle
point into the body of an insect.” He infers that the cephalic
glands may be the source of this poisonous secretion. The poisonous
salivary fluid of the larva of Dyticus is referred to on p. 324.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the mosquito injects poison into the wound it makes has
been proved by Macloskie, who discovering fine droplets of a yellow
oily-looking fluid escaping from the end of the hypopharynx, afterwards
detected the poison-glands. It appears that the two salivary
glands are subdivided, each into three lobes, the middle of which
(Fig. 351, <i>pg</i>) differs from the others in having evenly granulated
contents and staining more deeply than the others. Having examined
the preparations, we agree with the discoverer that these lobes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>secrete the poison. The poison is diluted by the secretion of the
salivary lobes, and the two efferent ducts, one from each set of
glands, “carry forward and commingle the venomo-salivary products
in the main duct; and the stream is then carried by the main duct
to the reservoir at the base of the hypopharynx.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>f.</i> Adhesive or cement-glands</h4>

<p class='c016'>Dewitz has discovered in ants and bees, in close connection with
the poison-glands, and like them discharging their secretion through
the sting, cement-glands. They arise by budding at the base of the
poison-glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two glands in these Hymenoptera correspond to the tubular
glands of the Orthoptera, which open at the base of the inner sheath
of the ovipositor (Fig. 299, <i>sb</i>), so that the secretion flows out through
it as the poison of bees, etc., out of the sting. The use of the secretion
of these glands is either to glue the eggs together, or to afford
material for the egg-case of cockroaches and Mantidæ and the gummy
egg-case of the locusts, etc. The contents of the cement-glands serves
for the fixture of the eggs after deposition. In the stinging Hymenoptera
one of the cement-glands is an accessory gland; the other
becomes the poison-sac. The cement-glands are in the Hemiptera
only short blind sacs, in the Lepidoptera and Diptera long convoluted
tubes, tubular and branched in the Coleoptera, or richly
branched in the Ichneumonidæ and Tenthredinidæ. In the cockroach
there are two cement-glands, but the right one is probably
of no functional importance. The left one is filled with a milky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>substance, containing many crystals and a coagulable fluid, out of
which the egg-capsule (oötheca) is formed. (Miall and Denny.)
In the locusts the sebific or cement-gland (Fig. 298, <i>sb</i>) secretes a
copious supply of a sticky fluid, which is poured out as the eggs pass
out of the oviduct and agglutinates the eggs into a mass, forming
a thin coating around each egg, which from the mutual pressure
of the eggs causes the tough coating to be pitted hexagonally. In
other insects also (Trichoptera, Chrysopidæ, Lepidoptera, etc.) there
are similar secretions for the protection or fastening of the eggs
when laid.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a> The Trichoptera lay their eggs either in or on the
surface of the water in bunches or in strings or in annular gelatinous
masses on stones or on plants. This jelly-like substance is secreted
by two highly developed paired anal glands. (Weltner, in Kolbe,
p. 621.) Also in certain dragon-flies (Libellula, Diplax, and Epitheca)
the eggs are laid in jelly-like masses.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a similar secretion, spun from the end of the abdomen, the
Psocidæ cover their little bunches of eggs laid on the under side of
leaves; and the silk thread forming the egg-sac of the great water-beetle
(Hydrophilus) is secreted from such anal glands.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>g.</i> The wax-glands</h4>

<p class='c016'>Besides the honey-bee, which secretes wax in little scales on the
under side of the abdomen, the bodies of many other insects, such
as the plant and bark lice, as well as the Psyllidæ, Cicadidæ (especially
Flata and Lystra), are covered with a waxy powder, or as in
Chermes, Schizoneura, Flata, etc., with
wool-like filaments of wax.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>The wax is secreted by minute unicellular dermal glands, which
in the lower insects (Hemiptera) are distributed nearly all over the
body, but in the bees are restricted either to the under (Apis, Fig. 352)
or upper side (Trigona) of the end of the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wax-glands of Pemphigus, Chermes, etc., lie under the little
warts, seen in <i>Lachnus strobi</i>, the white-pine aphis, to be distributed
in transverse lines across the back and sides of the abdominal segments
(Fig. 353). These warts are surrounded by a chitinous ring,
and divided into delicately marked areas. Through the delicate
numerous pits in the chitinous membrane of these areas the little
waxen threads project, since under each area ends a duct leading
from a large glandular cell, which is a specially modified hypodermis
cell (Claus). The wax threads are hollow, and all those arising from
a single glued cell form a bundle, whose threads separate from each
other and form a white woolly down or bloom covering the body.
Witlaczil also shows that gall-forming Aphids secrete a wax-like
substance, which, during the movements of the insects in the gall, is
rubbed off, becoming a watery layer mixed with the fluid excrement,
which forms a spherical impervious layer lining the gall, and thus
rendering possible the mode of life of the gall-lice.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Psyllidæ Witlaczil has discovered wax-glands which also
secrete slender waxen threads. They are situated in groups of two
or three at the end of the abdomen near the anus, and arise from
hypodermis cells. The wax threads surround the liquid excrement
as it passes out of the vent, covering it with a continuous layer of
wax. The excrement accordingly is discharged very slowly and
gradually, in sausage-shaped masses slightly strung together and
rolled into close spirals. The body becomes unavoidably smeared
with the sticky excrement, since it is not entirely covered by the
waxy layer. Moreover, in the larvæ of many Psyllidæ waxen threads
are formed on the upper side of the abdomen; they are for the most
part tightly curled or frizzly, like wool, and form, though partly
torn, a waxen coat, chiefly on the side and back of the thorax and
abdomen. The insects appear therefore as if covered with dust.
The mature animals of many species are also covered with a waxen
down. The wax threads rapidly dissolve and disappear in alcohol.
From a wax-like substance more or less easily dissolved in alcohol
arise peculiar hair-like structures which, in the larvæ of Psyllidæ,
are situated on the side and end of the body and also on the rudiments
of the wings. They are readily distinguished from ordinary
hairs, as they arise from glandular cells, and are of very different
lengths, more or less like bristles, but hollow, and very brittle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>They are leaf-like in the first nymphal stages of <i>Trioza rhamni</i>, but
in following stages become narrow and form a row around the entire
periphery of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The waxen dorsal shield which protects the body of bark-lice
(Coccidæ) is a similar product.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Witlaczil has described the way it is formed in Aspidiotus and Leucaspis.
The freshly hatched nymph shows no signs of a waxy secretion. But eventually
waxen threads arise first on the hinder and anterior end of the body, and then
over the whole surface. These threads interlace into a sort of felting and thus
form the shield, which is usually much larger than the body and lies closely
upon it. The shield is formed after the first moult. It is noteworthy that these
threads are matted together to form as thick a tissue as that of the shield itself.
The shield is whitish or gray and rather thin. On the thinnest part of the edge
the single threads may be drawn out. The growth of the shield advances with
the increase in size of the nymph around the entire edge, but is greatest behind.
The first two larval skins are retained on the back under the shield. Also a
very thin waxen pellicle remains on the resting place of the insect when it is
raised. The wax-glands open in the pitted fields, and appear as clear brownish
cells which are distinguished from the ordinary hypodermis cells by their greater
size. (Witlaczil. Compare also Fig. 354.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wax-glands in the honey-bee are scale-shaped organs situated
on the under side of the four last abdominal segments (Fig. 355).
These secrete the wax, which appears as whitish scales, and secretion
is only possible when the bees have sufficient honey and pollen.
The wax is secreted by the hypodermal cells rather than by glands
within the abdominal cavity; the wax traverses the cuticular layer,
and accumulates on its outer surface (Carlet). According to Fritz
Müller, in the stingless bees (Trigona) which he observed, the wax-glands
are situated on the back of the abdomen, but Ihering states
that in many species of Trigona and Melipona there are also slightly
developed wax-organs on the ventral side.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been found that certain caterpillars secrete wax. Thus the cells
of the Tortrix of the fir (<i>Retinia resinella</i>) formed of resin are lined with
wax, as on dissolving away the resin with alcohol, Dr. Knaggs found a slight
film of wax; also a secretion of wax has been detected in the larva of a butterfly
(<i>Parnassius apollo</i>). The bodies of certain saw-fly larvæ are covered with a
white powdery secretion, while the remarkable larva of a Selandria is clothed
with snow-white, long, flocculent, waxy masses, nearly concealing the body
(Fig. 356).</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>h.</i> “Honey-dew” or wax-glands of Aphids</h4>

<p class='c016'>The so-called “honey-dew” of Aphids which oozes from two wart-like
tubercles or tubes situated near the end of the body, is secreted
by hypodermal unicellular glands which open into a modification of
a pore-canal, the tube itself being an outgrowth of the cuticula.</p>

<p class='c013'>Witlaczil states that both in the “honey” tubes and in the body beneath, the
sugary matter exists in cells of the connective tissue in the form of granules.
“These large ‘sugar-cells’ in contact with the air undergo destruction, while
the sugar crystallizes into needles, and thus each cell is transformed into a
radiated crystalline mass.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>“A muscle extends from a horseshoe-shaped place (a valve?) in the middle of
the flat terminal plate of the honey tube, through this and down through the
abdomen to the ventral surface. By this muscle the honey tube is at times
erected, and we then find, as also when we lightly press the body of the insect,
lumps of crystallized sugar which have been expressed through the tips of the
honey tubes.” (Zool. Anzeiger, 1882, p. 241.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Busgen, after careful research, denies that this is a sugar, but claims as the
result of chemical analysis, that it is more like wax. He observed that on reaching
the air the drops issuing from the “nectary” or “honey” tube stiffened
almost instantly into a wax-like mass, which was easily crushed between the
teeth, and had no taste at all. No sugar-like substance or urea could be detected.
He therefore concludes that the secretion in question should be regarded as a
wax-like mass, which agrees well with
Witlaczil’s anatomical observations, and
confirms the statements of previous observers.
Thus, as early as 1815, Kyber
stated that the Aphides expelled an excrementitious
substance through the “sap
tubes.” Burmeister states that the tubes give out a fluid which “dries gumlike,
but, so far as I have observed, has no peculiar taste.” Réaumur, and also
Kaltenbach, state that the “honey” does not issue from the tubes, but from the
anus. Lastly, Forel emphatically states that “the two dorsal tubes of Aphides
do not secrete a sweet fluid, but a gluey wax, which is not sought by the ants.
Moreover the shield-lice and many leaf-lice have no such tubes, but yet are
often sought by ants. The drops of sugar which the ants lick up are rather the
excrement of the insects in question.” Hence the opinion first stated by Linné,
that a sweet fluid is secreted by Aphides, must be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, Busgen, after careful observations, finds that the use of
the sticky, waxen secretion is in reality a protective one, as he observed that
when a larval Chrysopa rudely attacks the Aphides, they smear its face with
the sticky wax, causing at least a momentary interruption in its attacks. He
also observed that Aphides when invaded by coccinellid larvæ set their tubes
in motion and besmear their heads and front part of the body. He thus seems
to establish the fact that these tubes secrete a protective, sticky fluid.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>i.</i> Dermal glands in general</h4>

<p class='c016'>We have seen that certain of the hypodermal cells may be modified
or specialized to form secretory unicellular glands. Such are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>those (trichogens) which secrete chitinous setæ, hairs, and spines,
certain setæ in some insects being hollow and containing a poison
(p. 187); others secrete wax, certain ones in Aphids “honey-dew”; in
some cases dermal glands may excrete protective, sticky, or otherwise
offensive matters, or may be depuratory, or facilitate the process
of moulting.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are other minute, unicellular, or compound dermal glands
whose function is unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dermal glands may be segmentally or serially arranged. Thus
Verson has detected a series of one or two pairs of unicellular glands
near the stigmata in each thoracic, and the first eight abdominal
segments of the silkworm (<i>B. mori</i>). In the earliest stages of
growth of the caterpillar they give out oxalate of lime, and in later
stages uric acid. They thus appear to act interchangeably with the
urinary tubes, as excretory organs. They do not, however, carry
their products directly outwards, but leave them between the hypodermis
and cuticula, in order to facilitate the sloughing off of the
latter in the process of moulting.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>DEFENSIVE OR REPUGNATORIAL SCENT-GLANDS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>While these eversible glands are not found in marine or aquatic
arthropods such as Crustacea or Merostomata (Limulus), they are
often present in the air-breathing forms, especially insects. In the
winged insects they are of frequent occurrence, existing under great
variety of form, varying greatly in position, and appearing usually
to be in immediate relation with their active volant habits. Their
presence is in direct adaptation to the needs and habits of their
possessors, and being repellent, warning, or defensive structures, the
odors they secrete being often exceedingly nauseous, they appear to
have been called into existence in direct response to their biological
environment. The fact that these singular organs do not exist in
marine or aquatic Crustacea suggests that the air-breathing, aërial, or
volant insects by these eversible glands, usually in the form of simple
evaginable hypodermic pouches, are enabled to protect themselves
by emitting an infinitesimal amount of an offensively odorous fluid
or ether-like spray which charges the air throughout an extent of
territory which may be practically illimitable to the senses of their
enemies. The principle is the same as in the mephitic sulphuretted
oil ejected by the skunks, the slight quantity these creatures give
out readily mixing with and charging the atmosphere within a radius
of many miles of what we may call the centre of distribution.</p>

<p class='c007'>As is now well known, the very delicate, attenuated highly volatile
odors exhaled are perceived by insects with extreme ease and
rapidity, the degree of sensitiveness to such scents being enormously
greater than in vertebrates, their organs of sense being developed in
a corresponding degree. Professors Fischer and Penzoldt, of Erlangen,
have recently established the fact that the sense of smell is
by far the most delicate of the senses. They find that the olfactory
nerve is able to detect the presence of <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>2,760,000,000</span></span> of a grain of mercaptan.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
The smallest particle of matter that can be detected by the
eye is sodium, when observed by the spectroscope, and this particle
is 250 times coarser than the particle of mercaptan which can be
detected by the human nose.</p>

<p class='c013'>In those Arachnida which are provided with poison-glands, these scent-glands
are absent, but in certain Acarina and Linguatulidæ, which have no poison-glands,
there are various oil-glands, stigmatic glands, as well as scent-glands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>and in seizing a Thelyphonus with the forceps we have observed it to send out
from each side of the body a jet of offensive spray.</p>

<p class='c013'>We not infrequently find in myriopods (Polydesmidæ, Julidæ, and Glomeris)
repugnatorial or the so-called cyanogenic glands, which are either paired, opening
on the sides of the body, or form a single row along the median line of the
under side of the body. Leidy describes and figures the spherical glands of
<i>Julus marginatus</i>, of which there are 50 pairs. These glands have been regarded
as modified nephridia, but are more probably coxal glands, and the homologues
of the parapodial glands of annelid worms.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Eversible coxal glands.</b>—True coxal glands occur in <i>Scolopendrella
immaculata</i> on the 2d to 11th segment, on the inner side of the base
of the legs (Fig. 15, <i>c.g.</i>). Homologous glands also occur in the same
position in <i>Campodea staphylinus</i> (also in <i>C. cookei</i> and <i>C. mexicana</i>)
on the 1st to 8th abdominal
segments, and Oudemans has
described a pair of eversible
sacs on each side of segments
one to seven of Machilis.
These eversible sacs
in the synapterous insects
are evidently modified coxal
glands, and are probably repugnatorial
as well as respiratory
in function.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apparatus consists of
an eversible gland, composed of hypodermic cells, usually retracted
by a slender muscle and with an efferent passage, but the glands
vary greatly in shape and structure in different insects. In some
cases these fœtid glands appear not to be the homologues of the coxal
glands, but simply dermal glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>These repugnatorial glands are of not infrequent occurrence in the
lower or more generalized winged insects, and in situation and appearance
are evidently the homologues of the coxal glands of the
Symphyla and Synaptera.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fœtid glands of Orthoptera.</i>—In the ear-wigs (Forficula and Chelidura)
Meinert has detected a pair of what he calls fœtid glands at
the posterior margin of the dorsal plates of the 2d and 3d abdominal
segments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vosseler also describes the same glands as consisting of a retort-shaped
sac, in whose walls are numerous small hypodermal cells and
large single glandular cells provided with an efferent passage, the
fluid being forced out by the pressure of the dermal muscles, one
acting specially to retract the gland. The creature can squirt to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>distance of 5 and even 10 cm. (4 inches) a yellowish-brown liquid or
emulsion with the odor of a mixture of carbolic acid and creosote.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large eversible dorsal glands of the Blattidæ, since they contain
numerous hairs, which, when everted, are fan-like or like tufts,
serve, as in the spraying or scent apparatus, to disseminate the odor,
and might be classified with the alluring unicellular scent-glands or
<i>duftapparat</i> of other insects, as they are by some authors; but as the
glands are large and compound they may prove to be the homologues
of the coxal glands rather than of the dermal glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evaginable organs in the Blattids were first observed by Gerstæcker
in both sexes of Corydia; they are yellowish white, covered with
hairs, and are thrust out from between the dorsal and ventral plates
of the 1st and 2d abdominal segments.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the cockroach (<i>P. orientalis</i>) Minchin detected two pouch-like
invaginations of the cuticle, lying close on each side of the middle
line of the body between the 5th and 6th tergites of the abdomen.
They are lined by a continuation of the cuticle, which forms, within
the pouches, numerous stiff, branched, finely pointed bristles, beneath
which are a number of glandular epithelial cells. In the male nymph
of <i>P. decorata</i> he also found beside these glandular pouches “an additional
gland, opening by a tubular duct under the intersegmental
membrane between the 5th and 6th terga above the glandular pouch
of each side, and extending forward into the body cavity. The gland
and its duct are proliferations of the hypodermis, and there is no invagination
of the cuticle.” These eversible glands are most complicated
in <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i>. While it is absent in the female,
in the male it is relatively of enormous size, extending over the 6th
and 7th somites, as well as projecting far into the body cavity (Minchin).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Haase states that these glands become everted by blood-pressure
and give out the well-known disagreeable smell of these
insects. He states that in the male of <i>P. germanica</i> the dorsal glands
in the 6th and 7th abdominal segments are without hairs and produce
an oily secretion; they function as odoriferous organs in sexual
union.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the male of another Blattid (<i>Aphlebia bivittata</i>) of the Canary
Islands, Krauss has detected two yellowish dorsal sacs 1.5 mm. in
length, opening out on the 7th abdominal segment, and filled full of
long yellowish hairs, the ends directed towards the opening, where
they form a thick tuft. These eversible glands lined with hairs
appear to be closely similar to the long slender eversible hairy
appendages or scent organs of certain Arctian and Syntomid moths.

</div>

<p class='c007'>We have found the external median wart with lateral lids or flaps
in between the 5th and 6th tergites of <i>Platyzosteria ingens</i> Scudder,
a large wingless Blattid living under the leaf
scars of the cocoanut tree in Southern Florida
(Fig. 360), but were unable to detect them in
Polyzosteria or in the common Blabera of Cuba,
or in another genus from Cordova, Mexico.</p>

<p class='c007'>In another group of Orthoptera, the Phasmidæ,
occur a pair of dorsal prothoracic glands,
each opening by a pore and present in both
sexes. In the walking-stick, <i>Anisomorpha buprestoides</i>, ♂ and ♀,
these openings are situated on each side of the prothorax at its
upper anterior extremity, situated at the bottom of a large deep pit.
When seized it discharged a “milky white fluid from the pores
of the thorax, diffusing a strong odor, in a great measure like that
of the common Gnaphalium or life everlasting” (Peale in Say’s
American Entomology, i, p. 84). Boll states that the females when
captured “spurt from the prothorax, somewhat after the manner of
bombardier beetles, a strong vapor, which slightly burnt the skin;
when the females were seized by the males a thick fluid oozed from
the same spot.” Scudder describes these glands in another Phasmid
(<i>Autolyca pallidicornis</i>) as two straight, flattened, ribbon-like bodies,
with thick walls, broadly rounded at the end, lying side by side and
extending to the hinder end of the mesothorax. In <i>Anisomorpha
buprestoides</i> the glands are of the same size and shape (Scudder).
In <i>Diapheromera femorata</i> the repugnatorial foramina are very
minute, and the apparatus within consists of a pair of small obovate
or subfusiform sacs, one on each side of the prothorax, about 1 mm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>in length, with a short and very slender duct opening externally at
the bottom of the pit (Scudder).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Mantidæ these seem to be genuine coxal glands, as there
is a pair situated between the coxæ of the first pair of legs. An
evaginable organ like a wart, with a glandular appearance, occurs
on the hind femora of the Acrydiidæ in a furrow on the under side,
into which the tibia fits, about one-fourth from the base (Psyche,
iii, p. 32).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the male cricket, the anal odoriferous glands are small lobes
opening into a reservoir on each side of the rectum (Dufour). Homologous
glands also occur in the Coleoptera (Fig. 302, <i>l</i> and 317, <i>s</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Most Hemiptera or bugs send out a fœtid or nauseous odor due
to a fluid secreted by a single or double yellow or red pear-shaped
gland, situated in the middle of the mesothoracic segment, and
opening between the hinder or third pair of coxæ. In Belostoma
Leidy describes these glands as consisting
of two rather long cœcal tubes situated
in the metathorax, beneath the other viscera,
extending backwards into the abdomen,
and opening between the coxæ
of the third pair of legs. Locy states
that the smell arising from these glands
is pleasant, resembling that of well
ripened pears or bananas. Other bugs,
moreover, emit an agreeable odor, that
of Syromastes resembling that of a fine
bergamot pear. (Siebold.) The fluid
given out by the European fire-bug
(<i>Pyrrhocoris apterus</i>) has a sweetish
smell, like ether. In the nymph there
are three pairs of dorsal glands, on abdominal segments 2–5, which
are atrophied in the mature insect. In the bed-bug, the nymph has
three odoriferous glands each with paired openings in the three
basal abdominal segments respectively, and situated on the median
dorsal line, being arranged transversely at the edge of the tergites;
but after the last moult these are aborted, and replaced by the sternal
metathoracic glands (Künckel). Gissler has detected a pair of
glands in <i>Lachnus strobi</i> (Fig. 361).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Anal glands of beetles.</b>—Certain beetles are endowed with eversible
repugnatorial glands. <i>Eleodes gigantea</i> and <i>E. dentipes</i> of both
sexes are said by Gissler to possess these glands. When teased
“they stand on their anterior and middle legs, holding the abdomen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>high up and spurting the contents of the glands right and left.”
The glands (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>1</span>) are two reddish brown, somewhat bilobed
sacs, and extend from the base of the last up to the middle of the
2d abdominal segment, with an average length of 6.5 mm. The
liquid stains the human skin, has an acid reaction, with a peculiar,
“intensely penetrant odor, causing the eye to lachrymate. It is
soluble in water, alcohol, and ether. Boiled with concentrated sulphuric
acid and alcohol an ethereal aromatic vapor is produced,
indicating the presence of one or more organic acids, though neither
formic or acetic acid could be detected.” Williston has observed the
same habits in seven other species of Eleodes, all ejecting a pungent
vile-smelling liquid, one species (<i>E. longicollis</i>) ejecting a stream of
fluid from the anal gland, backwards sometimes to the distance of
10 cm. or more, and he regards these beetles as “the veritable skunks
of their order.” Leidy briefly describes the odoriferous glands of
<i>Upis pennsylvanica</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The anal glands consist, according to Meckel and also Dufour, of
two long, simple, flexuous cœca with reservoirs having two short
excretory ducts situated near the anus (Siebold).</p>

<p class='c007'>Glands like those of Eleodes found in <i>Blaps mortisaga</i> are described
in detail by Gilson (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>2</span>). They form two pouches or
cuticular invaginations situated in the end of the abdomen on the
sides of the end of the intestine and unite on the median line underneath
the genital organs, forming a very short tube with a chitinous
wall, continuous with the cuticle of the last abdominal segment.
Into each pouch open a large number of fine slender lobules varying
in shape, giving a villous aspect to the surface. These lobules are
composed of as many as fifty unicellular glands, each of which is
composed of four parts: (1) A radiated vesicle, (2) a central sac,
giving rise (3) to a fine excretory tube, and (4) a sheath near the
origin of the excretory tube. These are all modifications of the
cytoplasm of the cell with its reticulum; the nucleus with its chromosomes
is also present, but situated on one side of the central sac.
The fine excretory tubules form a bundle passing down into the
mouth of each lobule.</p>

<p class='c013'>Similar glands, though usually smaller, which have not been carefully examined,
occur in Carabus (Fig. 300, <span class='small'>3</span>) and Cychrus, which eject from the vent a
disagreeable fluid containing butyric acid (Pelouse). The bombardier beetle
Brachinus, with its anal glands, ejects a jet of bluish vapor accompanied with
a considerable explosion, which colors the human skin rust red; it is caustic,
smells like nitrous acid, and turns blue paper red. Westwood states that individuals
of a large South American Brachinus on being seized “immediately
began to play off their artillery, burning and staining the flesh to such a degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>that only a few specimens could be captured with the naked hand, leaving a
mark which remained for a considerable time.” The fluid ejected by another
species, in Tripoli, blackened the fingers of the collector. “It is neither alkaline
nor acid, and it is soluble in water and in alcohol.” (Kirby and Spence,
iv, p. 149.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Species of other genera (Agonum, Pheropsophus, Galerita, Helluo, Paussus,
Ozæna) are also bombardiers, though less decidedly so than Brachinus. A
Paussid beetle (Cerapterus) ejects explosively a fluid containing free iodine
(Loman), while Staphylinus, Stenus, Ocypus olens, Lacon, etc., have similar
anal fœtid glands, the liquid being more or less corrosive. The secretion of
<i>Mormolyce phyllodes</i> is so corrosive that it is said to paralyze the fingers for 24
hours after. (Cuénot.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The two pairs of remarkably large, soft, eversible, forked, orange-yellow
glands of the European genus Malachius, are thrust out from
the side of the 1st and the 3d thoracic
segments. They are everted
by blood-pressure, and retracted by
muscles. The larva of <i>Hydrophilus
piceus</i> ejects by the anus a
black, fœtid fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Claus has shown that the larva
of <i>Lina populi</i> and other Chrysomelidæ
possess numerous minute,
eversible glands in each of the warts
on the upper surface of the body,
each gland containing a whitish,
repellent fluid smelling like the oil
of bitter almonds and containing
salicylic acid derived from its food-plant,
which issues as pearl-like
drops. Candèze thinks the fluid may
contain prussic acid. The fluid is
secreted by a variable number of
glandular cells, each provided with
an efferent duct. The larvæ of saw-flies,
notably <i>Cimbex americana</i>, also eject droplets of a clear fluid from
non-evaginable glands situated near each stigma (Chlolodkovsky).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The blood as a repellent fluid.</b>—In this connection it may be
mentioned that though there are no special glands present, many
beetles emit drops of blood from the femoro-tibial joints of their
legs as a means of defence. Such are the oil-beetles (Meloë), Cantharis,
Lytta. The cantharadine secreted by these beetles, according
to Beauregard, is an efficient means of defence, as birds, reptiles,
and carnivorous insects will not usually attack them. This substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>is formed in the blood and also in the genital organs, and is
so extremely caustic that scavenger insects which feed upon their
dead bodies will leave untouched the parts containing cantharadine,
and if May-beetles or mole-crickets are washed with the blood of
Meloë or with cantharidate of potassa, it will for several days render
them safe from the attacks of the carabids which usually prey upon
them. The eggs even after deposition are strongly vesicant, and
are thus free from the attacks of egg-eating insects (Cuénot). The
Coccinellidæ are also protected by a yellow, mucilaginous, disagreeable
fluid oozing out of the ends of the femora; in our common, two-spotted
lady-bird (<i>C. bipunctata</i>) the yellow fluid is disagreeable,
smelling like opium. Lutz has found that the blood in Coccinellidæ
passes out through a minute opening situated at the end of each femur
(Fig. 362). The blood is very repellent to insectivorous animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dyticidæ eject from the anus a colorless, disagreeable fluid,
while these beetles, and especially the Gyrinidæ, when captured
send out a milky fluid which appears to issue from the joints of
the body. The Silphidæ throw out both from the mouth and vent
a fœtid liquid with an ammoniacal odor. They possess but a single
anal gland, the reservoir opening on one side of the rectum (Dufour).</p>

<p class='c007'>Other malodorous insects have not yet been investigated; such
are the very persistent odors of lace-winged flies (Chrysopa).</p>

<p class='c007'>More agreeable secretions, but probably formed by similar glands,
is the odor of rose or hyacinth given out by Cicindelæ, or the rose
fragrance exhaled by the European <i>Aromia moschata</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Eversible glands of caddis-worms and caterpillars.</b>—Gilson, while
investigating the segmentally disposed thoracic glands of larval
Trichoptera, has found in the larva of <i>Limnophilus flavicornis</i> that
the sternal prothoracic tubercle gives exit to an underlying tubular
gland. In <i>Phryganea grandis</i> each thoracic sternum affords an exit
to an eversible gland. Many caterpillars, as our subjoined list will
show, are very well protected by eversible repugnatorial glands
situated either in the under or upper side of the body. Since the
time of De Geer (1750) the fork-tailed larva of Cerura has been
known to throw out a secretion, which was described by Bonnet in
1755 as a true acid, sharp, sour, and biting. This spraying apparatus
in <i>Cerura (Harpyia) vinula</i> has been well described by Klemensiewicz
(Fig. 366, 4), though Rengger in 1817 noticed the general
form of the secretory sac, and that it opens out in two muscular
eversible tubes, out of which the secretion is ejected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fork-tailed larva of <i>Macrurocampa marthesia</i>, which is much
like that of Cerura, when teased sends out a jet of spray to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>distance of nearly an inch from each side of the neck. While examining
the very gayly-colored and heavily-spined caterpillars of <i>Schizura
concinna</i> we observed that when a fully-grown one was roughly
seized with the forceps or fingers it sent out a shower of spray from
each side of the prothoracic segment, exactly like that of Cerura
and Macrurocampa.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the European <i>Cerura vinula</i> the apparatus consists of a single
sac, which opens by a narrow transverse slit on the under side of
the neck, out of which is rapidly everted four lateral tubes, two
on each side (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>4</span>, <i>t</i>), which are withdrawn within the opening
by the contraction of several fine muscles. The apparatus in
the American <i>C. multiscripta</i> is as in the European <i>C. vinula</i>. In
a living specimen the large secretory sac was seen to be of the same
size and shape as in Macrurocampa, and of the color of raw silk.
The sac when distended extends back to a little behind the middle
pair of legs, and is nearly two-thirds as wide as the body. The
caterpillar sent out the fluid when handled, but we could not make
it spray.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larva of <i>Macrurocampa marthesia</i> the cervical or secretory
gland (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>5</span>) is situated in the 1st and 2d thoracic segments,
extending to the hinder edge of the latter and lying between the
nervous cord and the œsophagus and proventriculus, and when
empty the bulk of it lies a little to one side of the median line
of the body. It is partly held in place by small tracheæ, one quite
large branch being sent to it from near the prothoracic spiracle.
The short, large duct, leading from it to the transverse opening in
the membrane between the head and prothoracic segment, is a little
narrower than this opening, and is kept distended by tænidia, or a
series of short, spiral threads which are pale, not honey-yellowish,
in color. This duct lies on one side of the prothoracic ganglion,
resting just under the commissures passing up to the brain; it is
also situated between the two silk ducts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very distensible sac (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>5</span>) is rendered elastic by a
curious arrangement of the cuticle, the tænidia of the duct itself
being represented by very thickly-scattered, irregular, separate, sinuous,
chitinous ridges, which stand up from the cuticular lining of
the wall of the sac (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>6</span>). The secretory cells of the walls
of this sac in <i>Cerura vinula</i> are said by Klemensiewicz to be large
hexagonal cells, resembling those of silk-glands, having like them
large branched nuclei.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fluid thrown out is said by Poulton to be formic acid; it
causes violent effervescence when allowed to fall upon sodium-bicarbonate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>and colors blue litmus paper red. It also appears from
the researches of Latter that these creatures in the imago state
secrete free potassium hydroxid, a substance for the first time known
to exist in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the caterpillar of <i>Astyanax archippus</i> (<i>Limenitis disippus</i>) a
dark, bladder-like sac is everted, but the lateral tubes appear to
be wanting, and no spray is sent out; it occurs in the larvæ of
many Nymphalidæ and other butterflies and moths.</p>

<p class='c007'>These glands are functionally active in Perophora, but obsolete (at
least the external openings) in Lacosoma.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The osmeterium in Papilio larvæ.</b>—The caterpillars of the swallowtailed
butterflies (Papilio, Doritis, and Thais), as is well known, when
irritated thrust out from a transverse slit on the upper part of the prothoracic
segment a large orange-yellow V-shaped fleshy tubular process
(the osmeterium), from which is diffused a more or less melonlike
but disagreeable, in some cases insufferable, odor; the secretion
is acid and reddens litmus paper. The mechanism has been described
and figured by Klemensiewicz.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at rest, or retracted, the osmeterium lies in the upper part
of the body in the three thoracic segments, and is crossed obliquely
by several muscular bundles attached to the walls of the body, and
by the action of these muscles the evagination of the osmeterium is
strongly promoted. After eversion the tubes are slowly retracted
by two slender muscles inserted at the end of each fork or tube, and
arising from the sides of the 3d segment behind the head, crossing
each other in the median line (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>7</span> <i>r.m.</i>). The secretion is
formed by an oval mass of glandular cells at the base of the forks;
in the glandular mass is a furrow-like depression about which the
secretory cells are grouped. The secretion collects in very fine drops
on the side of each furrow opposite the glandular cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to C. D. Ash the larva of an Australian Notodontid
(<i>Danima banksii</i> Lewin) protrudes from the under side of the prothoracic
segment a <span class='mono'>Y</span>-shaped red organ like that of Papilio; no fluid
or odor is given out.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Dorsal and lateral eversible metameric sacs in other larvæ.</b>—The
showy caterpillars of Orgyia and its allies have a conspicuous coral-red
tubercle on the back of the 6th and also the 7th abdominal segment,
which on irritation are elongated, the end of the tubercles
being eversible. When at rest the summit is crateriform, but on
eversion the end becomes rounded and conical. These osmeteria
are everted by blood pressure, and retracted by a muscle. Fig. 366, <span class='small'>9</span>,
represents a section of an osmeterium of <i>Orgyia leucostigma</i> when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>retracted by the muscle (<i>m</i>); at the bottom of the crater are the
secreting or glandular cells (<i>gc</i>), being modified hypodermal cells.
These doubtless serve as terrifying organs to ichneumons and other
insect enemies, and though we have been unable to detect any odor
emanating from the tubercles,
yet possibly they give out a
scent perceived by and disagreeable
to their insect assailants.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Hemileucidæ there is
a pair of lateral osmeteria, on
the 1st and on the 7th abdominal
segments, which however,
are not highly colored (Figs. 363, 366, <span class='small'>10</span>). In Megalopyge (Lagoa,
Fig. 364) there is a lateral row of singular pale permanently everted
processes which appear to be the homologues of the osmeteria of
larvæ of other lepidopterous families. As these are repeated on
seven segments, their metameric arrangement is obvious. The relation
of these curious glands to the viscera is seen in Fig. 297, <i>lgp</i>,
and their minute structure in Fig. 365.</p>

<p class='c013'>At <i>A</i>, the lumen (<i>l</i>) is a deep narrow cavity, with the secretion (<i>secr.</i>), collected
at the mouth of the cavity, composed of a thin, mucus-like, coagulated
fluid, containing granules of varying degrees of fineness, which take the stain
readily. Outside of these are collected fine nuclei (<i>bc</i>), stained dark, and
enveloped in a slight, transparent, pale, protoplasmic envelope, which may be
blood corpuscles. The glandular cells themselves are simply modified hypodermal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>cells, as seen at <i>C</i>. In some of the nuclei, indistinct nucleoli are seen, and
deeply stained granules, especially around the periphery of the nuclei. At <i>B</i> is
represented a section on one side of the middle, but still showing the spacious
lumen. In the section represented by <i>C</i>, the knife passed through the process
still nearer the outer edge, and near the base; at <i>C<sup>1</sup></i>, three of the glandular
cells, with their large, deeply stained nuclei, are drawn. A transverse section
at <i>D</i> shows the large lumen or cavity (<i>l</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the function and homologies of these structures, it is difficult to decide.
We have never noticed that they give off any odor, though they may prove to
be repugnatorial; they are not visible in the fully grown, living insect, being
concealed by the long, dense hairs clothing the body; they are not spraying
organs, as they are imperforate at the end, not ending as the lateral, eversible
glands of <i>Hyperchiria io</i>, etc., in a crateriform orifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>They may be permanently everted glands, or osmeteria, which have, by disuse,
lost their power of retraction and their crateriform opening, as well as the
power of secreting a malodorous fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>In certain of the butterflies, the Heliconidæ (Colænis, Heliconius,
Euides, and Dione), there is thrust from the end of the abdomen a
pair of large, irregular, rounded, eversible glands, which give out
a disagreeable odor, and are consequently repellent, and which seem
to be the homologues of the odoriferous glands of other butterflies.</p>

<p class='c013'>The large, soft, rounded, eversible glands, looking like puff-balls or a rounded
pudding (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>12</span>), are everted, when the butterflies are roughly seized, from
the dorsal side of the penultimate segment of the abdomen. The males possess
two smaller tubercles on the inside of the anal claspers or lobes. Müller also
detected, in the females of various species of the Heliconidæ enumerated above,
a pair of club-shaped processes like the balancers of flies, which are thrust out
on each side of and under the odoriferous puff-balls of the hinder edge of the
penultimate segment (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>13</span>). The club or head is armed with hairs or
bristles, which, in Heliconius, are like the scales of a butterfly.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In the caterpillars of certain blue butterflies (Lycænidæ) is an internal
osmeterium, being a very minute sac which is everted from a
transverse slit on the top of the 7th abdominal segment. Its function
is quite the opposite of those of the caterpillars of other families,
since the sac exudes a sweet fluid very attractive to ants, which
may be diffused more widely by the delicate spinulose bristles crowning
the summit. W. H. Edwards states that in several species of
Lycæna, besides that on the 7th abdominal segment, there is on
the 8th segment a pair of minute dorsal evaginable tubercles.</p>

<p class='c007'>A pair of small ramose odoriferous glands are said by Siebold, who
regarded them as alluring glands, to occur in Argynnis, Melitæa, and
Zygæna, to be situated near the orifice of the oviduct, and Scudder
has detected them near the anus of the female pupa of <i>Danais archippus</i>.
The appearance of the odoriferous glands in the pupa of <i>Vanessa
io</i> is well shown by Jackson (Fig. 366, <span class='small'>14</span>). They develop as two
tubular ingrowths of the hypodermis, perfectly distinct one from the
other, each having its own separate aperture to the exterior. In
Fig. 366, <span class='small'>14</span> the condition of parts is nearly as in the imago, the glands
being situated below the rectum and opening of the oviduct. In
both sexes of another Brazilian butterfly (<i>Didonis biblis</i>) on the median
line of the abdomen between the 4th and 5th segments are two
roundish vesicles covered with short gray hairs, which emit a disagreeable
smell.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is possible that the dark-green fluid in Parnassius, secreted by an evaginable
gland, and which is moulded into shape by the scimetar-shaped peraplast (Scudder),
is formed by the homologues of the anal glands of other butterflies.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE ALLURING OR SCENT-GLANDS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It is difficult to draw the line between repelling and alluring
glands. Attention was first definitely called to the alluring odors
of Lepidoptera by Fritz Müller, who showed that the males of certain
butterflies are rendered attractive to the other sex by secreting odorous
oils of the ether series. He pointed out that the seat of the odor
is the androconia (see p. 199), while either repellent or pleasant
odors are exhaled from abdominal glands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those of <i>Pieris napi</i> yield a scent like that of citrons, <i>Didonis biblis</i> gives off
three different odors from different parts of the body, besides having a distinctly
odorous spot on the hind wings. Both sexes have a sac between the fourth and
fifth abdominal segments which exhales a very unpleasant (protective) odor,
while the males have on the succeeding segment a pair of glands from which
proceeds an agreeable odor like that of the heliotrope. <i>Callidryas argante</i> throws
off a musky odor. In <i>Prepona laertes</i> the odor is like that of a bat, in <i>Dircenna
xantho</i> it is vanilla-like, the androconia being situated on the front edge of the
hind wings. In <i>Papilio grayi</i> the odor is said to be as agreeable and intense as
in flowers. Certain sphingids are known to exhale a distinct odor, which Müller
has traced to a tuft of hair-like scales at the base of the abdomen, and which fits
into a groove in the first segment, so as to be ordinarily invisible.</p>

<div  class='figright id019'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><i>Fig. 367.</i>—Scent-tufts: 1, of <i>Leucarctia acræa</i>; 2, of <i>Pyrrarctia isabella</i>.—After Smith.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the noctuid genus, Patula, the costal half of the hind wing is modified to
form a large scent-gland, and in consequence the venation has been modified.
The still greater distortion of the veins in the allied genus, Argida, was attributed
by the author to its once having
possessed a similar scent-gland,
now become rudimentary by disuse.
(Hampson.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Peculiar white or orange-colored,
hairy, thread-like processes have
been found protruding from narrow
openings near the tip of the
abdomen of Arctian moths (Fig.
367), which throw off, according to
J. B. Smith, “an intense odor,
somewhat like the smell of laudanum.”
We have perceived the
same unpleasant odor emanating
from the males of <i>Spilosoma virginica</i>
and <i>Arctia virgo</i>, as well
as <i>Leucarctia acræa</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are informed by C. Dury
that similar but longer hairy appendages
are thrust out by the
male of <i>Haploa clymene</i>. Many glaucopid moths protrude similar glandular
processes. Thus Müller tells us that on seizing a glaucopid female by the
wings, nearly the whole body became enveloped in a large cloud of snow-white
wool which came out of a sort of pouch on the ventral side of the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The male of a glaucopid was seen to dart out a pair of long hollow hairy retractile
filaments which in some species exceed the whole body in length. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>apparatus secretes a peculiar odor, probably serving to allure the female (Nature),
and certain Zygænidæ have on the inner side of the paranal lobes (Afterklappen)
glands filled with a sweetly scented fluid. Smith has detected a peculiar
brush of hair-like scales in a groove between the dorsal and ventral parts of the
basal two segments of the abdomen of <i>Schinia marginata</i> (family Noctuidæ),
and when removed it exhaled a laudanum-like smell.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pupa of <i>Citheronia regalis</i> gives out from the end of the abdomen a scent
reminding us of laudanum.</p>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 368.</span>—Scent-tufts on middle legs of <i>Catocala concumbens</i>.—After Bailey.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Another mode of disseminating pleasant, alluring odors is that of
the males of certain moths, which bear pencils and tufts on their fore
or hind legs, and in the case of an Indian butterfly on the greatly
elongated palpi. Those on the legs are ordinarily concealed in cavities
or furrows in the leg, and may be thrust out and expanded so as
to widely diffuse their odor. Such are those
of the males of Catocala (Fig. 368), which
resemble an artist’s fitch brush. In <i>Hepialus
hecta</i>, where the arrangements for protecting
the tufts are quite abnormal, Bertkau has
detected the cells which secrete the odorous
fluid. In the male of another Hepialus (<i>H.
humuli</i>) a peculiar scent proceeds from the
curiously aborted and altered hind tibiæ.
(Barrett.) In one case, that of a geometrid
moth (<i>Bapata dichroa</i> of New Guinea), these
pencils occur on all the legs. (Haase). In
many species a distinct odor is perceptible
when the leg bearing the pencil or tuft is
crushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>These eversible scent-glands have been supposed to be mostly
restricted to the Lepidoptera, and to a single known case in the Trichoptera,
but similar alluring male glands also occur in the Orthoptera
(Locustidæ). H. Garman has described and figured in the cave
cricket (<i>Hadenœcus subterraneus</i>) “a pair of white fleshy appendages
protruding from slits between the terga of the 9th and 10th abdominal
somites, the nature of which is not clear,” adding, “the slits
through which the organs appear are situated one on each side
anterior to and a little within the cerci. When fully protruded, the
glands are white, cylindrical, a little tapering, and are about one-eighth
of an inch long.” He believes that they are protruded during the
period of sexual excitement, and suggests that “the sense of smell is
certainly the one best calculated to bring the sexes together in the
darkness of caves.” We had previously noticed these organs in
alcoholic specimens, but supposed that they were fungous growths.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>On dissecting and making microscopic sections of them, the gland is,
when extended (Fig. 369), seen to be a long, ensiform, sharp, band-like
process, with numerous retractor muscular fibres. When at rest
each gland is folded about five times, forming a bundle lying on each
side of the end of the intestine. The walls are formed of a single
layer of epithelium, as seen in Fig. 369, <i>B</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the male of the common wingless cricket, <i>Ceuthophilus maculatus</i>,
we have discovered what appears to be a pair of scent-glands lying
directly over the last abdominal ganglion. They form two large
white sacs situated close together, with a short common duct which
passes back and opens externally upwards by a transverse slit on the
under side of the last segment of the body.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Although Malpighi was the first to discover the heart in the
young silkworm, it was not until 1826 that Carus proved that there
was a circulation of blood in insects, which he saw flowing along
each side of the body, and coursing through the wings, antennæ,
and legs of the transparent larva of Ephemera, though three years
earlier Herold demonstrated that the dorsal vessel of an insect is a
true heart, pulsating and impelling a current of blood towards the
head. This discovery was extended by Straus-Dürckheim, who discovered
the contractile and valvular structures of the heart. It is
noteworthy that both Cuvier and Dufour denied that any circulation,
except of air, existed in insects; and so great an anatomist as
Lyonet doubted whether the dorsal vessel was a genuine heart,
though he pointed out the fact that there are no arteries and veins
connected with this vessel. Another French anatomist, Marcel de
Serres, thought that the dorsal vessel was merely the secreting
organ of the fat-body.</p>

<p class='c013'>The so-called peritracheal circulation claimed by Blanchard and by Agassiz has
been shown by McLeod to be an anatomical impossibility, the view having
first been refuted by Joly in 1849.</p>

<p class='c013'>Except the aorta-like continuation in the thorax and head which divides into
two short branches, there are, with slight exceptions (p. 405), no distinct
arteries, such as are to be found in the lobster and other Crustacea, and no
great collective veins, such as exist in Crustacea and in Limulus. This is
probably the result of a reduction by disuse in the circulatory system, since in
myriopods (Julidæ and Scolopendridæ) lateral arteries are said to diverge near
the ostia.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The heart</h4>

<p class='c016'>The heart or “dorsal vessel” is a delicate, pulsating tube, situated
just under the integument of the back, in the median line of the
body, and above the digestive canal. It can be partially seen without
dissection in caterpillars. It is covered externally and lined
within by membranes which are probably elastic; and between these
two membranes extends a system of delicate muscular fibres, which
generally have a circular course, but sometimes cross each other.
The heart is divided by constrictions into chambers, separated by
valvular folds. The internal lining membrane referred to forms the
valvular folds separating the chambers. Each of these chambers
has, at the anterior end, on each side, a valvular orifice (Fig. 370,
ostium, <i>i</i>) which can be inwardly closed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>Miall and Denny thus describe the different layers of the wall of the heart of
the cockroach:</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are: (1) a transparent, structureless intima, only visible when thrown
into folds; (2) a partial endocardium, of scattered, nucleated cells, which passes
into the interventricular valves; (3) a muscular layer, consisting of close-set,
annular, and distant, longitudinal fibres. The annular muscles are slightly
interrupted at regular and frequent intervals, and are imperfectly joined along
the middle line above and below, so as to indicate (what has been independently
proved) that the heart arises as two half-tubes, which afterwards join along the
middle. Elongate nuclei are to be seen here and there among the muscles. The
adventitia (4), or connective tissue layer, is but slightly developed in the adult
cockroach.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Graber says that the heart of insects may be regarded not as an
organ <i>de novo</i>, but only as the somewhat modified contractile dorsal
vessel of the annelids, in which, however, the transverse arteries arising
on each side became, with the gradual development of the tracheæ,
superfluous and finally abortive. He describes it as a muscular
tube composed of very delicate annular fibres, which within and
without is covered by a relatively homogeneous, strong, elastic
membrane.</p>

<p class='c013'>The division into separate chambers is effected by means of a folding inwards
and forwards of the entire muscular wall. “A portion of each side of the
heart is first extended inwards so as very nearly to meet a corresponding portion
from the opposite side, and then, being reflected backwards, forms, according to
Straus (Consid., etc., p. 356), the interventricular valve which separates each
chamber from that which follows it. Posteriorly to this valve, at the anterior
part of each chamber, is a transverse opening or slit (Fig. 371, <i>b</i>), the <i>auriculo-ventricular
orifice</i>, through which the blood passes into each chamber, and
immediately behind it is a second, but much smaller, <i>semilunar valve</i> (<i>c</i>), which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>like the first, is directed forwards into the chamber. It is between these two
valves on each side that the blood passes into the heart, and is prevented from
returning by the closing of the semilunar
valve. When the blood is passing into the
chamber, the interventricular valve is
thrown back against the side of the cavity,
but is closed when, by the contraction of
the transverse fibres, the diameter of each
chamber is narrowed, and the blood is
forced along into the next chamber.”

</div>

<p class='c013'>According to Müller, there is but a single
pair of ostia in Phasma, and, in the larva
of Corethra, the heart is a simple, unjointed
tube, not divided into chambers, and Viallanes
states that, in the very young larva
of Musca, there are no ostia (Kolbe). In
the larva of Ptychoptera, Grobben found a
short oval heart, with one pair of ostia
situated in the 6th abdominal segment; a
long aorta proceeds from it, the thoracic
portion of which pulsates; from behind
the heart arises a pulsating
pouch, which connects
with the hinder
aorta, which does not
pulsate, and ends at the
base of two tracheal
gills. Burmeister was
able to find only four
pairs of openings in the
larva of Calosoma.
Newport states that,
while Straus figures
nine chambers in Melolontha,
and, consequently,
eight pairs of
openings, he has not
been able to observe
more than seven pairs
of openings in <i>Lucanus
cervus</i>. He has invariably
found eight pairs
of openings both in the
larva and imago of
<i>Sphinx ligustri</i>, as well
as in other Lepidoptera.
According to Béla-Dezso,
the number of pairs
of ostia corresponds to
that of the pairs of stigmata.</p>

<p class='c013'>There also occur, on each side of each chamber, two so-called pear-shaped
bodies which are separated from the tubular portion of the heart itself, but, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>means of muscular fibres, are united with the chamber and with their valves.
These pyriform bodies appear as vesicles or cells with granular contents, besides
some nuclei with nucleoli. They are of very small size. According to the
measurements of Dogiel, in the larva of <i>Corethra plumicornis</i>, they are 0.02 to
0.1 mm. long, and 0.06 to 0.08 mm. broad. He regards these peculiar bodies as
apolar nerve-cells of the heart. (Kolbe.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Besides the venous openings of the heart which open into the pericardial
region, Kowalevsky has discovered, in the heart of some Orthoptera (Caloptenus,
Locusta, etc.), five pairs of openings by which the cardiac chambers receive the
blood of the peri-intestinal region. Graber had divided the cœlom of insects
into three regions (pericardial, peri-intestinal, and perineural regions), and
hitherto only a union of the heart with the pericardial region by slit-like openings
was known. These openings are symmetrically distributed on five abdominal
segments; each section of the heart in this region has, therefore, four
openings, which are all of a truly venous nature. These openings, called
cardio-cœlomic apertures, are visible to the naked eye, being situated on conical
papillæ of the walls of the heart. These papillæ pass through the outer diaphragm,
and open into the peri-intestinal part of the cœlom, in the Acrydiidæ
directly, in the Locustidæ through special canals. The cells of the papillæ are
spongy, possessing large nuclei, and similar, as a whole, to glandular cells.
(Comptes rendus, cxix, 1894.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The mechanism by which the ostia are closed consists, according to Graber,
of an ∞-shaped muscle passing around the two openings, and which, being interlaced,
is sufficient to close the openings. But this is not all. The fore and
hinder edge of the ostia project, leaf-like, into the cavity of the heart, and thus
form, with the outer walls, two valves which, during the systole, filled with the
blood rushing in, not only hermetically close the lateral openings, but also, by
the simultaneous closure of the entire chamber by the circular muscles in the
middle of the same, the two valves, simultaneously approaching each other, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>nearly touch that they form a transverse partition wall in the chamber. But,
for the last purpose, <i>i.e.</i> for the separation of the chambers from one another,
there is a very special contrivance. In the May beetle, we find, besides a valve
(Fig. 373, <i>B</i>, <i>e</i>), opening into the middle of the chambers, a large, stalked cell
(<i>d</i>), which, in the diastole, <i>i.e.</i> in the expansion of the heart, hangs down free
on the walls of the heart; but, in the systole or contraction, like a cork, closes
the middle of the valve, but does not wholly close the cavity. He has observed,
in the larva of Corethra, formal, interventricular valves, which also are not in
the middle, but are separated from one another in the interlaced ends. They
consist of two longitudinally membranous flaps which move against each other
like two valves (Fig. 373, <i>B</i>, <i>b</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what is the necessity for such a complicated mechanism? All the
blood from behind passes into the heart, and, for its propulsion a simple muscular
tube, whose circular fibres would draw together and contract it, would be
thought to be sufficient. But the heart, except in some larvæ, ends posteriorly
in a blind sac, and the blood can only pass into it by a series of pairs of lateral
openings. Now, as regards the reception and the propulsion of the blood
forwards, two modes are conceivable. The simplest way would be that the
tubular heart should, along its whole length, contract or expand; that, moreover,
the blood should be simultaneously sucked in through all the openings,
and that then, also, the contraction, or systole, should take place in every part
of the heart at the same moment. But this would, plainly, in so long and thin-walled
a vessel, be highly impracticable, since, through such a manipulation, the
mass of blood enclosed in the heart would be crowded together rather than
really impelled forwards. Only the second case could be admissible, and that
is this, that each chamber pulsates, one after another, from behind forwards.
But, then, each segmental heart must be separated from the others by a valve.
To make the matter wholly clear, we may observe an insect heart pulsating, and
this is best seen in one of its middle chambers. This chamber expands (simply
by the relaxation of its circular muscles), the ostia, also, consequently open,
and a given quantity of blood is drawn in from the pericardial cavity. What
now would happen after the succeeding contraction if there were no valves
between? The blood would not flow forwards, but seek a way out backwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, in fact, the valve of the hinder chamber, at this time, closes itself,
while, by the simultaneous expansion of the anterior ones, their door opens, and
this section of the heart, at the same time, causes a sucking in of the contents
of the posterior chamber. This phenomenon is repeated, in the same way, from
chamber to chamber, which also acts alternately as ventricle and auricle, or by
a sucking and pumping action. One is involuntarily reminded of the ingenious
manipulation by which, by the alternate opening and shutting of the flood-gates,
a vessel is carried along a canal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This wave-like motion of an insect’s heart also has the advantage that, just
before a pulse-wave has reached the chambers farthest in front, the hinder ones
are already prepared for the production of a second, for, as a matter of fact,
often 60, and even 100, and, in very agile insects, 150, waves pass, in a single
minute, through the series of chambers, which make it very difficult to follow
the flowing of their waves.” (Graber.)</p>

<p class='c013'><b>The propulsatory apparatus.</b>—But the heart itself is only a part of the
entire propulsatorial apparatus to which belongs the following contrivance, the
nature of which has been worked out by Graber.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the dorsal vessel is stretched a sort of roof-like diaphragm, <i>i.e.</i> a
membrane, arched like the dorsal wall of the hind-body which is attached, in a
peculiar way, to the sides of the body. The best idea can be gained by a cross-section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>through the entire body (Fig. 374): <i>H</i> is the true dorsal vessel; <i>S</i>, the
diaphragm. A surface view is seen at 373, <i>C</i>, <i>b</i>, where it appears as a plate with
the edge regularly curved outwards on each side. Its precise mode of working is
thus: from each dorsal band of the sides of the abdomen arises a pair of muscles
spreading out fan-like, and extending to the heart, so that the fibres of one side
pass directly over to those of the other, often splitting apart, or, between the
two, extends outwards a perforated, thin web, like an elastic, fibrous sheet
(Fig. 373, <i>A</i>, <i>a</i>), with numerous perforations, forming a diaphragm.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Graber has thus explained the action of the pericardial diaphragm and chamber,
as freely translated by Miall and Denny: “When the alary muscles contract,
they depress the diaphragm, which is arched upwards when at rest. A
rush of blood towards the heart is thereby set up, and the blood streams through
the perforated diaphragm into the pericardial chamber. Here it bathes a
spongy or cavernous tissue (the fat-cells), which is largely supplied with air-tubes,
and having been thus aerated, passes immediately forwards to the heart,
entering it at the moment of diastole,
which is simultaneous with the sinking
of the diaphragm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the cockroach, however, Miall
and Denny think that the facts of
structure do not altogether justify this
explanation: “The fenestræ of the
diaphragm are mere openings without
valves. The descent of a perforated
non-valvular plate can bring no pressure
to bear upon the blood, for it is
not contended that the alary muscles
are powerful enough to change the
figure of the abdominal rings....
The diaphragm appears to give mechanical
support to the heart, resisting
pressure from a distended alimentary canal, while the sheets of fat-cells, in
addition to their proper physiological office, may equalize small local pressures,
and prevent displacement. The movement of the blood towards the heart must
(we think) depend, not upon the alary muscles, but upon the far more powerful
muscles of the abdominal wall, and upon the pumping action of the heart itself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The peculiar office,” says Graber, “performed by the heart has already
been stated. It is nothing more than a regulator; than an organ for directing
the blood in a determinate course in order that this may not wholly stagnate, or
only be the plaything of a force acting in another way, as, for example, through
that afforded by the body-cavity and the inner digestive canal. At regular
intervals a portion of the blood is sucked through the same, and then by means
of the anterior supply tube it is pushed onward into the head, whence it passes
into the cavities of the tissues. The different conditions of tension under which
the mass of blood stands in the different regions of the body then causes a
farther circulation. Besides this, the blood passes through separate smaller
pumping apparatuses, and through vessel-like modifications of cavities, also
through hollow spaces between the muscles, as, for example, in the appendages
where a regular backward and forward flow of the blood, especially in the limbs,
wings, antennæ, and certain abdominal appendages takes place. Here and there
may occasionally occur a narrow place where the flow of blood is obstructed by
the accumulation of the blood corpuscles, causing a considerable stagnation.”

<p class='c007'><b>The supraspinal vessel.</b>—In many insects there is a ventral heart
acting on the heart’s blood as an aspirator, or more correctly a
ventral sinus lying on the nervous cord,
and closed by a pulsating diaphragm.
This was discovered by Réaumur in the
larva of a fly, and by Graber in the
dragon-fly and locusts (Acrydiidæ).
A glance at Figs. 375 and 376 will
save a long description. The ventral
wall forms a furrow, and between its
borders (Fig. 377, <i>e</i>) extends the diaphragm.
During the contraction of
the muscles—and this, here, acts
from before backwards—the membrane
rises up and makes a cavity
for the blood, which passes backwards
over the nervous cord. The
dorsal and ventral sinuses together
thus bring about a closed circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It thus appears that the insects are
well provided with the means of
distribution of their nutritive fluid,
and that the blood is kept continually
fresh and rich in oxygen.
(Graber.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span><b>The aorta.</b>—While the heart is mostly situated within the
abdomen, it is continued into the thorax and the head as a simple,
non-pulsating tube, called the aorta. In Sphinx the aorta, as described
by Newport, begins at the anterior part of the 1st abdominal
segment, where it bends downwards to pass under the metaphragma
and enter the thorax; it then ascends again between the great
longitudinal dorsal muscles of the wings, and passes onwards until
it arrives at the posterior margin of the pronotum; it then again
descends and continues its course along the upper surface of the
œsophagus, with which it passes beneath the brain, in front of which
and immediately above the pharynx, it divides into two branches,
each of which subdivides. Newport, however, overlooked a thoracic
enlargement of the aorta called by Burgess the “aortal chamber”
(Fig. 310, <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>“In Sphinx and <i>Vanessa urticæ</i>, immediately after the aorta has passed
beneath the cerebrum, it gives off laterally two large trunks, which are each
equal in capacity to about one-third of the main vessel. These pass one on
each side of the head, and are divided into three branches which are directed
backwards, but have not been traced farther in consequence of their extreme
delicacy. Anterior to these trunks are two smaller ones which appear to be
given to the parts of the mouth and antennæ, and nearer the median line are
two others which are the continuations of the aorta. These pass upwards, and
are lost in the integument. The whole of these parts are so exceedingly
delicate that we have not, as yet, been able to follow them beyond their origin
at the termination of the aorta, but believe them to be continuous, with very
delicate, circulatory passages along the course of the tracheal vessels. It is in
the head alone that the aorta is divided into branches, since, throughout its
whole course from the abdomen, it is one
continuous vessel, neither giving off branches,
nor possessing lateral muscles, auricular orifices,
or separate chambers.” (Newport, art.
Insecta, p. 978.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Dogiel observed in the transparent
larva of <i>Corethra plumicornis</i> that the
aorta extends only to the hinder border
of the brain. Here it divides into two
lamellæ, each of which independently
extends farther on. One lamella is
seen under the brain and under the
eye, the other reaches near the eye.
The lamellæ are tied to the integument
by threads. At the point of division of
the aorta is an opening. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c013'>True blood-vessels appear to exist in the caudal appendages of the May-flies,
as the heart appears to divide and pass directly into them (Fig. 378). The last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>chamber of the heart diminishes in size at the end of the body, and then divides
into three delicate tubular vessels which pass into the three caudal appendages,
and extend to the end of each one, along the upper side. While the valves of the
heart, in all insects, are directed anteriorly because the blood flows from behind,
in the larva of the Ephemeridæ the valves of the last chamber of the heart are
directed backwards, because from this chamber the blood flows in the opposite
direction, <i>i.e.</i> into the caudal appendages. During the contraction of the heart,
the elongated section of the same in the last abdominal segment receives a part
of the mass of blood contained in the last chamber, which is driven by independent
contractions into the caudal appendages. These vessels have openings
before the end through which the blood enters into the cavity of the appendages,
and can also pass back, in order to be taken up by the body cavity. It is possible
that these blood-vessels stand in direct relation to respiration. (Zimmermann,
Creutzburg, in Kolbe, p. 544.)</p>

<p class='c013'><b>The pericardial cells.</b>—Along the heart, on both sides, occur the so-called
pericardial cells, which differ from the fat-cells, and also the peritracheal cells
of Frenzel, and are mostly arranged in linear series, which have a close relation
to the circulation of the blood. In the larva of Chironomus, they lie in groups;
in that of Culex, they are arranged segmentally. In caterpillars, these pericardial
cells are not situated in the region of the heart, but are arranged linearly
on the side, and form a network of granulated cells situated between the fat-bodies.
Other rows of these cells are situated near the stigmata and the main
lateral tracheæ. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c013'>According to Kowalevsky, the pericardial cells, and the garland-shaped, cellular
cord consist of cells, whose function it is to purify the blood, and to remove
the foreign or injurious matters mingled with the blood.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Ampulla-like blood circulation in
the head.</b>—In the head of the cockroach
occurs, according to Pawlowa,
a contractile vascular sac at the base
of each antenna. The cavity has a
valvular communication with the
blood space below and in front of
the brain, and muscle-fibres effect
systole and diastole. Each sac is
beyond doubt an independently active
part of the circulatory system.
These organs also occur in Locusta
and other Acrydiidæ, and Selvatico
has described similar structures
in <i>Bombyx mori</i> and certain other
Lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Pulsatile organs of the legs.</b>—Accessory to the circulation is a special system
of pulsatile organs in the three pairs of legs of Nepidæ, generally situated in the
tibia just below its articulation with the femur, but in the fore legs of Ranatra,
in the clasp-joint or tarsus, just below its articulation with the tibia. First
observed by Behn (1835), Locy has studied the organ (Fig. 380) in Corixa,
Notonecta, Gerris, besides the Nepidæ. It is a whip-like structure attached at
both ends, with fibres extending upward and backward to the integument of the
leg, separate from the muscular fibres and does not involve them in its motions,
and is not affected by the muscles themselves. “As the blood-corpuscles flow
near the pulsating body they move faster, and around the organ itself there is a
whirlpool of motion.” The beating of these organs aids the circulation in both
directions, and when the motion ceases, the blood-currents in the legs stop; the
rate of the pulsating organ is always faster than that of the heart, and the action
is automatic.</p>

  <h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The blood</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The blood of insects, as in other invertebrates, differs from that of
the higher animals in having no red corpuscles. It is a thin fluid, a
mixture of blood (serum) and chyle, usually colorless, but sometimes
yellowish or reddish, which contains pale amœboid corpuscles corresponding
to the white corpuscles (leucocytes) of the vertebrates,
though they are relatively less numerous in the blood of insects.
The yellow fluid expelled from the joints of certain beetles (Coccinella,
Timarcha, and the Meloidæ) is, according to Leydig, only the
serum of the blood. In phytophagous insects the blood is colored
greenish by the chlorophyll set free during digestion. The blood of
<i>Deilephila euphorbia</i> is colored an intense olive-green, and that of
<i>Cossus ligniperda</i> is pale yellow. (Urech.) The blood of case-worms
(Trichoptera) is greenish. In some insects it is brownish or violet.
The serum is the principal bearer of the coloring material, yet
Graber has shown that in certain insects the corpuscles are more or
less beset with bright yellow or red fat-globules, so as to give the
same hue to the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The leucocytes.</b>—The corpuscles are usually elongated, oval, or
flattened oat-shaped, with a rounded nucleus, or are often amœbiform;
and they are occasionally seen undergoing self-division.
When about to die the corpuscles become amœbiform or star-shaped.
(Cattaneo.) Their number varies with the developmental stage of
the insect, and in larvæ increases as they grow, becoming most
abundant shortly before pupation. The blood diminishes in quantity
in the pupal stage, and becomes still less abundant in the imago.
(Landois.) The quantity also varies with the nutrition of the
insect, and after a few days’ starvation nearly all the blood is
absorbed. Crystals may be obtained by evaporating a drop of the
blood without pressure; they form radiating clusters of pointed
needles. The freshly drawn blood is slightly alkaline. (Miall and
Denny.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The size of the corpuscles has been ascertained by Graber, who found that the
diameter of the circular blood-disks of the leaf-beetle, <i>Lina populi</i>, is 0.006 mm.;
of <i>Cetonia aurata</i> and <i>Zabrus gibbus</i>, 0.008 to 0.01 mm.; and those of certain
Orthoptera <i>(Decticus verrucivorus</i>, <i>Ephippiger vitium</i> and <i>Œdipoda cœrulescens</i>),
0.011 to 0.014 mm. The longest diameter of the elongated corpuscles of <i>Carabus
cancellatus</i> is 0.008 mm.; of <i>Gryllus campestris</i>, <i>Locusta viridissima</i>, <i>Cossus
ligniperda</i>, <i>Sphinx ligustri</i> (pupa), and others, 0.008 to 0.01 mm.; of <i>Caloptenus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>italicus</i>, <i>Saturnia pyri</i>, <i>Anax formosus</i>, and others, 0.011 to 0.014 mm.; of
<i>Ephippiger vitium</i>, <i>Œdipoda cœrulescens</i>, <i>Pezotettix mendax</i>, <i>Zabrus gibbus</i>,
<i>Phryganea</i>, and others, 0.012 to 0.022 mm.; in <i>Stenobothrus donatus</i> and <i>variabilis</i>,
0.012 to 0.035 mm. The largest known are those of <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>,
which measure from 0.027 to 0.03 mm.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As regards the nature of the corpuscles, Graber concludes that they
are more like the cells of the fat-bodies than genuine cells. That
they are not true cells is shown by the fact that after remaining in
their normal condition a long time they finally coalesce and form
cords. After shrivelling, or after the blood has been subjected to
different kinds of treatment, the nucleus is clearly brought out
(Fig. 381).</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the blood corpuscles there have been detected in the blood
round bodies which are regarded as fat-cells. They are circular, and
for the most part larger than the blood corpuscles, have a sharp,
even, dark outline, and an invariably circular nucleus. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The blood of Meloe, besides the amœboid corpuscles, according to Cuénot,
contains abundant fibrinogen, which forms a clot; a pigment (uranidine), which
is oxidized and precipitated when exposed to the air; a dissolved albuminoid
(hæmoxanthine), which has both a respiratory and nutritive function; and,
finally, dissolved cantharidine.</p>

<p class='c013'>The corpuscles arise from tissues which are very similar to the fat-bodies,
and which, at given times, separate into cells. The position of these tissues is
not always the same in different insects. In caterpillars, they occur in the
thorax, near the germs of the wings; in the saw-flies (Lyda), in all parts of the
thorax and abdomen; in larval flies (Musca), in the end of the abdomen, just in
front of the large terminal stigmata. The place where the blood corpuscles are
formed is usually near, or in relation with, the fat-bodies. But while the fat-bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>mostly serve as the material for the formation of the blood-building
tissues, in caterpillars the tracheal matrix also, and, in dipterous larvæ, the
hypodermis serve this purpose. (Cæsar Schaeffer in Kolbe. See also Wielowiejski,
Ueber das Blutgewebe.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Other substances occur in the blood of insects. Landois (1864) demonstrated
the existence of egg albumen, globulin, fibrin, and iron in the blood of caterpillars.
Poulton found that the blood of caterpillars often contained chlorophyll
and xanthophyll derived from their food plants. A. G. Mayer has recently
found that the blood (hæmolymph) of the pupæ of Saturniidæ (<i>Callosamia promethea</i>)
contains egg albumin, globulin, fibrin, xanthophyll, and orthophosphoric
acid, and Oenslager has determined that iron, potassium, and sodium are
also present. (Mayer.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> The circulation of the blood</h4>

<p class='c016'>Every part of the body and its appendages is bathed by the blood,
which circulates in the wings of insects freshly emerged from the
nymph or pupal state, and even courses through the scales of Lepidoptera,
as discovered by Jaeger (Isis, 1837).</p>

<p class='c007'>In describing the mechanism of the heart we have already considered
in a general way the mode of circulation of the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heart pumping the blood into the aorta, the nutritive fluid
passes out and returns along each side of the body; distinct, smaller
streams passing into the antennæ, the legs, wings (of certain insects),
and into the abdominal appendages when they are present. All
this may readily be observed in transparent aquatic insects, such as
larval Ephemeræ, dragon-flies, etc., kept alive for the purpose under
the microscope in the animalcule box.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carus, in 1827, first discovered the fact of a complete circulation
of the blood, in the larva of Ephemera. He saw the blood issuing in
several streams from the end of the aorta in the head and returning
in currents which entered the base of the antennæ and limbs in which
it formed loops, and then flowing into the abdomen, entered the posterior
end of the heart. Wagner (Isis, 1832) confirmed these observations,
adding one of his own, that the blood flows backward in
two venous currents, one at the sides of the body and intestine, and
the other alongside of the heart itself, and that the blood not only
entered at the end of the heart, but also at the sides of each segment,
at the position of the valves discovered by Straus-Dürckheim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Newport maintains that the course of the blood is in any part of
the body, as well as in the wings, almost invariably in immediate
connection with the course of the tracheæ, for the reason that “the
currents of blood in the body of an insect are often in the vicinity
of the great tracheal vessels, both in their longitudinal and transverse
direction across the segments.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>The circulation of the blood in the wings directly after the exuviation
of the nymph or pupa skin, and before they become dry, has
been proved by several observers. As stated by Newport, the so-called
“veins” or “nervures” of the wings consist of tracheæ lying
in a hollow cavity, the peritracheal space being situated chiefly under
and on each side of the trachea.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Newport gives the following summary of the observations of the early observers,
to which we add the observations of Moseley. “A motion of the
fluids has been seen by
Carus in wings of recently
developed Libellulidæ,
<i>Ephemera lutea</i> and <i>E.
marginata</i>, and <i>Chrysopa
perla</i>; among the Coleoptera,
in the elytra and
wings of <i>Lampyris italica</i>
and <i>L. splendidula</i>, <i>Melolontha
solstitialis</i> and
Dytiscus.” Ehrenberg
saw it in Mantis, and
Wagner in the young of
<i>Nepa cinerea</i> and <i>Cimex
lectularius</i>. Carus detected
a circulation in
the pupal wings of some
Lepidoptera, and Bowerbank
witnessed it in a
Noctuid (<i>Phlogophora
meticulosa</i>); Burmeister
observed it in <i>Eristalis
tenax</i> and <i>E. nemorum</i>,
and Mr. Tyrrel in <i>Musca
domestica</i>, but it has not
been observed in the
wings of Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bowerbank observed
that in the lower wing
of <i>Chrysopa perla</i> the
blood passes from the
base of the wing along
the costal, post-costal,
and externo-medial veins,
outwards to the apex of
the wing, giving off smaller currents in its course, and that it returns along
the anal vein to the thorax. He found that the larger veins, <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>408</span></span> in. in diameter,
contained tracheæ which only measured  <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>2222</span></span> of an inch in diameter;
but in others the tracheæ measured <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1340</span></span>, while the cavity measured only <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>500</span></span>
of an inch. He states, also, that the tracheæ very rarely give off branches
while passing along the main veins, and that they lie along the canals in a
tortuous course. (Newport, art. Insecta, p. 980.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Bowerbank, also, in his observations on the circulation in the wings of Chrysopa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>“used every endeavor to discover, if possible, whether the blood has proper
vessels, or only occupied the internal cavities of the canals; and that he is convinced
that the latter is the case, as he could frequently perceive the particles
not only surrounding all parts of the tracheæ, and occupying the whole of the
internal diameter of the canals, but that it frequently happens that globules
experienced a momentary stoppage in their progress, occasioned by their friction
against the curved surface of the tracheæ, which sometimes gave them a rotatory
motion.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Moseley found, owing to the large size and number of the corpuscles, that the
circulation of the blood in the wings of insects is most easily observed in the
cockroach, especially the hind wings. As seen in Moseley’s figure, the blood
flows outward from the body through the larger veins (I and II) of the front
edge of the wings, which he calls the main arteries of the wings, and more
generally returns to the body through the veins in the middle of the wing; the
blood also flows out from the body through the inner longitudinal veins (those
behind vein IV), and the blood is also
seen to flow through some of the
small cross-veins. Fig. 383 shows one
of the main trunks during active circulation.
The corpuscles change their
form readily, “the spindle-shaped ones
doubling up in order to pass crossways
through a narrow aperture.... In the
irregularly formed corpuscles, which
seem to represent leucocytes amœboid
movements were observed.... Corpuscles
pass freely above and under
the tracheæ, showing that these latter
lie free in the vessels.” The hypodermis
lining the vessels is best seen
in the small transverse veins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pulse or heart-beat of
insects varies in rapidity in different
insects, rising at times of
excitement, as Newport noticed
in <i>Anthophora retusa</i>, to 142 beats
in a minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>When an insect, as, for example, a tineid caterpillar, has been enclosed
in a tight box for a day or more, the pulsations of the heart
are very languid and slow, but soon, on giving it air, the pulsations
will, as we have observed, rise in frequency to about 60 a minute,
Herold observed 30 to 40 in a minute in a fully-grown silkworm,
and from 46 to 48 in a much younger one. Suckow observed but 30
a minute in a full-grown caterpillar of <i>Gastropacha pini</i>, and 18 only
in its pupa.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a series of observations made by Newport on <i>Sphinx ligustri</i> from the
fourth day after hatching from the egg until the perfect insect was developed,
he found that before the larva cast its first skin the mean number of pulsations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>in a state of moderate activity and quietude, was about 82 or 83 a minute; before
the second moult 89, while before the third casting it had sunk down to 63;
and before its fourth to 45, while, before leaving its fourth stage, and before it
had ceased to feed, preparatory to pupating, the pulse was not more than 39.
“Thus the number gradually decreases during the growing larva state, but the
force of the circulation is very much augmented. Now when the insect is in a
state of perfect rest, previously to changing its skin, the number is pretty nearly
equal at each period, being about 30. When the insect has passed into the pupa
state it sinks down to 22, and subsequently to 10 or 12, and after that, during
the period of hibernation, it almost entirely ceases. But when the same insect
which we had watched from its earliest condition was developed into the perfect
state in May of the following spring, the number of pulsations, after the insect
had been for some time excited in flight around the room, amounted to from 110
to 139; and when the same insect was in a state of repose, to from 41 to 50.
When, however, the great business of life, the continuation of the species, has
been accomplished, or when the insect is exhausted, and perishing through
want of food or other causes, the number of pulsations gradually diminishes,
until the motions of the heart are almost imperceptible.” Insects, then, he remarks,
do not deviate from other animals in regard to their vital phenomena,
though it has been wrongly imagined that the nutrient and circulatory functions
are less active in the perfect than in the larval condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>The heart of a larval <i>Gastrus equi</i> taken the day previous from a horse’s
stomach beat from 40 to 44 times a minute (Scheiber); while Schröder van der
Kolk observed only 30 beats in the same kind of maggot.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the larva of Corethra, while at rest, the heart contracts from 12 to 16 or 18
times a minute, but when active the number rises to 22. The systole and diastole
last from 5 to 6 minutes. (Dogiel.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Temperature also affects the pulsations, as they increase in frequency with
a rise and decrease with a fall in temperature.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Influence of electricity.</b>—The influence of electricity on the action of the
insect’s heart, from Dogiel’s experiments, is such as to cause an acceleration in
the frequency of the beats, while an increase in the strength of the electric currents
either diminishes the frequency of the beats or entirely stops the heart’s
action. A violent excitation with the induction current causes a systole when
the heart’s action has stopped for a long time; and if the excitation lasts uninterruptedly,
then the contractions after a while become noticeable, according to
the strength of the current. In such a case there are, however, interruptions
in the regularity, strength, and order of the contractions. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Effects of poisons on the pulsations.</b>—Dogiel has also experimented on the
influence of poisons in the form of vapor or as liquid solutions on the pulsations
of insects, which is much as in vertebrates. The application of carbonic oxide
to the larva of Corethra, whose heart one minute previous to the poisoning beat
15 times a minute, accelerated the heart-beats in about 55 minutes to 25 pulsations
in a minute. Afterwards there was a retardation in the pulse to the normal
beat. Carbonic acid had a similar effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following results obtained by Dogiel are somewhat as tabulated by
Kolbe:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The above-named substances comprise those which in the vertebrates effect
a change in the activity of the motor nerve-ganglia of the heart and the muscular
fibres. Hence it follows that the heart of the larval Corethra consists of
muscular fibres provided with ganglia, and that the contractions of the muscular
fibres are provoked through the agency of the ganglia. But since muscarine,
atropine, and curare, whose influence in stopping the heart’s action of vertebrates
is known, in insects either have no action or only make the pulsations
slower; it seems to follow that the heart of the larval Corethra possesses no
similar apparatus for lessening the heart’s action, and this is also confirmed by
anatomical studies. On the contrary, aconite acts, as we must from observations
conclude, exclusively on the motor centres and the muscles, but not on the apparatus
for lessening the heart’s action, which, as has been remarked, is not
present in the larval Corethra. (Kolbe <i>ex</i> Dogiel.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Dewitz has discovered an onward movement of the blood corpuscles, somewhat
independent of the general circulation. This independent motion of the
blood corpuscles is not only a creeping one like the amœboid motion of the white
corpuscles of vertebrates, but they have besides a peculiar swimming movement.
Dewitz noticed this in the hind wings of a recently emerged meal-worm beetle
(<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>), still white and soft, after they had been cut off. The tissues
forming the matrix within the wings constitute a network filled with blood.
The current of blood within the wing thus cut off may be stopped flowing by a
tap on the firmly clamped object-bearer on which the wing is placed, or by
drawing it by an apparatus described by the same author, to incite in one way
or another the blood corpuscles to swim forwards. When a corpuscle is disposed
to move, we see it first stirring restlessly, or wabbling about, in this way changing
its form; then it moves forwards, and does not come to a standstill. If it
remains still there, after a while, by tapping, it begins again its movements.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Should one yet doubt the fact of this spontaneous movement of the blood
corpuscles, he will surely be convinced of its correctness by observing the so-to-speak
reluctantly springing motion of a blood corpuscle in the wing of <i>Tenebrio
molitor</i> with the simultaneous change of appearance and shape of the corpuscle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This spontaneous or independent motion of the blood corpuscles is also produced
by the heating apparatus. As soon as the corpuscles lie still in the
severed wing and they are warmed, the corpuscles begin to pass through the
meshes of the tissue. When cooled, the motion ceases, but as soon as the temperature
rises to a certain grade, the corpuscles again move onwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>To explain this independent motion Dewitz thinks that they take up and then
expel the blood-fluid, and in this way cause their motion. This independent
motion is necessitated, in order that the stream of blood may become so regulated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>that the blood corpuscles shall not be arrested in their course, but even
turn back again out of the farther end of the antennæ and limbs. The chief
mechanical power for the blood circulation must go on independently of the
propulsatorial apparatus and of the heart. (Kolbe.)</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE BLOOD TISSUE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Under this name Wielowiejski has included several important
tissues or cellular bodies intimately concerned with the nutrition of
the insect. These are:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. The blood corpuscles. (See p. 407, leucocytes and phagocytes.)</div>
      <div class='line'>2. The fat-body proper (<i>Corpus adiposum</i>).</div>
      <div class='line'>3. The pericardial fat-body (pericardial cells).</div>
      <div class='line'>4. The œnocytes.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. The garland-shaped cord of muscid larvæ.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. The subœsophageal body, a peculiar organ found by Wheeler in the embryos and young larvæ of Blatta and Xiphidium.</div>
      <div class='line'>7. The phosphorescent organs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The fat-body</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the body cavity of winged insects and of their larvæ occur
yellowish masses of large cells filled with small drops of fat, and
forming the “fat-body.” It is of various shapes, more or less lobulated
or net-like, and covers or envelops parts of the viscera, also
forming a layer under the integument (Fig. 143). The tracheal
endings are usually enveloped by the fat-body. It is larger in the
larvæ than in the adults, especially in Lepidoptera, in them forming
a reserve of nutrition, used during metamorphosis and during the
formation and ripening of the eggs and male cells.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wielowiejski has shown that there is a regular arrangement of the fat-body in
the general cavity of the body. For example, in the larva of Chironomus
occur the following forms of this tissue. Around the periphery, on each side of
the body cavity, is a loose network of lobes with large meshes constituting the
peripheral layer or external lobular fat-body; these lobular masses are segmentally
arranged.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within these segmental lobes, on each side of and along the digestive tract,
extending along through almost the entire body, is an unbroken strand of this
tissue, forming the internal fat-body cords. From the first larval stage, and
even before hatching, its cells are so unusually large, being filled with large,
clear, mostly colorless fat-drops, that their limits cannot be defined, and their
nuclei can only with great difficulty be detected. Only in some large larvæ of
Chironomus has Wielowiejski found clearly defined cells; the protoplasm of
these cells contain almost no fat-drops.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fat-body is of mesodermal origin, and as Wheeler insists, is not derived
from the œnocytes, as supposed by Graber. Formed from the mesoderm, it is a
differentiation of portions of the cœlomic walls, and therefore metameric in
origin. That the fat-body gives origin to the blood corpuscles Wheeler is doubtful.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>The fat-cells are distinct, spherical, and as a rule possess only one nucleus,
though in those of Apis and Melophagus there are two nuclei, and in Musca
several. Sometimes the cells contain a substance like the white of an egg, and
concretions of uric acid, or these take the place of the fat-drops. The presence
of uric acid shows that a very active metabolism goes on in the fat-body. “In
some cases it has been proved that the fat-body in the larva is rich in fat and
poor in concretions of uric acid, while in the imago it is poor in fat and rich in
concretions of uric acid” (Lang).</p>

<p class='c013'>Leydig, in 1857 (Lehrbuch der Histiologie), spoke of the presence of dark
concretions in the fat-body, and afterwards (1864) showed that there was a
wide distribution of uric acid salts and concretions. Witlaczil, also, has detected
concretions in the fat-body of the Psyllidæ, in larval Cecidomyiidæ, in
the larvæ and pupæ of ants, and in the pupa of Musca.</p>

<p class='c013'>The physiological processes which take place in the fat-bodies are obscure.
Graber regarded the whole system of the fat-bodies as “a single, many-lobed
lung,” while before him Landois, taking into account the intimate relation
existing between the finer tracheal branches and the fat-body, considered that
the latter was concerned in respiration. Marchal thinks that the fat-body is a
urinary organ, as the urates are formed within the cells of this body.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moreover, Schäffer maintains that a special kind of fat-body cell has the
important function of taking up and giving out nutritious matters during the
internal processes of metamorphosis, while he also believes that there is a genetic
connection between the fat-body and the blood corpuscles—a view combated
by Wheeler.</p>

<p class='c013'>Kowalevsky finds that the fat-body remains absolutely insensible to the action
of the substances which stained the Malpighian tubes (p. 352). So long as the
cells are healthy and living they are not stained and do not absorb the colors in
question; and this insensibility persists, even when the cells are of a different
nature, as those of the fly (adipose and “intercalary” cells).</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The pericardial fat-body or pericardial cells</h4>

<p class='c016'>We have already, on p. 405, called attention to these organs, but
they also have an intimate relation to the fat-body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kowalevsky (1892) remarks that the disposition of these cells
varies much in different insects and even in the same animal. Thus,
in the Diptera and the ordinary flies there are found around the lower
part of the dorsal vessel 13 pairs of large pericardial cells which lie
next to a crowded bed of small cells forming a compact mass around
the anterior part of the dorsal vessel. In caterpillars, notably silkworms,
from the compact layer of pericardial cells which surround
the heart, pass off trunks which are directed towards the lateral
walls of the body, also forming close networks around the tracheæ
and then passing down into the abdominal cavity of the body of the
larva.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larvæ of certain Hymenoptera, the trunks which pass off
from the pericardial region form a loose cord, a sort of fatty tissue
covering the entire body cavity.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>This tissue, adds Kowalevsky, entirely differs from œnocytes, or from the so-called
glandular body whose formation in Gryllotalpa has been described by
Korotaiev, and in <i>Bombyx mori</i> by Tichomiroff. In a recent work wherein has
been collected everything known regarding these last-named cells, Pékarsky
proves that they are unique in nature and cannot be regarded either as fat-cells,
or as pericardial cells, or even as formative leucocytes.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the structure of the pericardial cells, Kowalevsky adds that
they are always attached to muscular fibres passing off from the
heart, and that they lie, so to speak, upon them. In the locusts the
muscular fibres supporting the pericardial cells appear distinctly
like little staves or sticks. The attachment of the pericardial cells
to the muscular fibres has been observed by Cuénot and reproduced
by him in his work, but his description somewhat differs from that
observed by Kowalevsky in the locust (<i>Acrydium migratorium</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the nature of the acid excretions which are formed in the pericardial
cells, in spite of his attempts to solve the problem, Kowalevsky has been unsuccessful.
The only observations in this direction are those of Letellier on the
pericardial glands of lamellibranch molluscs, which he found to contain hypouric
acid, and it is probable, says Kowalevsky, that the acidity of the pericardial
cells in insects is due to the presence of the same acid.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Leucocytes or phagocytes in connection with the pericardial cells.</b>—It
is thought by Schäffer that the leucocytes or phagocytes may
be free or wandering fat-body cells. They play an important part
in metamorphosis, while they absorb or feed upon the remains of
the larval organs, and thus prove of use in the building up of the
organs of the adult insects.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the faculty of <i>phagocytosis</i> is wanting in the urinary tubes,
Balbiani and more recently Cuénot have expressed the opinion that
the pericardial cells of insects may have the power of absorbing
hard bodies, “acting as a phagocytic gland.” This, however, is
called in question by Kowalevsky, from studies made on different
insects. On introducing powdered carmine into the body of an insect
it has not been absorbed by the pericardial cells, as they have
not been colored red. It is the leucocytes which absorb the grains
of carmine, and which, after having dissolved them, transmit them
to the pericardial cells. Hence, then, the pericardial cells have not
the phagocytic power of which Cuénot speaks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to his own observations on hard bodies introduced into
insects, or large globules introduced under the form of a milk emulsion,
Kowalevsky has found that these bodies were absorbed in the
first place by the free-swimming leucocytes, and in the second place
by whole groups or nests of leucocytes situated in different parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>of the body, principally on the threads of the adipose body. In
the Orthoptera the absorption is immediately effected by means of
the cells of the membrane
which separates the pericardium
from the cavity of
the body underneath the
heart. The regions where
the hard bodies are absorbed in great number
coincide with the regions
of formation of the blood
corpuscles. In his researches
on the larvæ of
Hyponomeuta and other
Lepidoptera, Schäffer describes
 these regions as
forming a sort of island.
The nests where the blood
globules are formed are the most active centres of phagocytosis.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Balbiani, and also Cuénot, have supposed that the formation of the blood
corpuscles takes place in the pericardial cells, but Kowalevsky insists that these
cells cannot form the leucocytes, which
“are probably formed in different
parts of the body, notably in the
special nests [<i>Herde</i> of Jäger] situated
near the heart, but outside of the
pericardial cells.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In Fig. 384, where the nests of
leucocytes (<i>l</i>) are shown, it is evident
that they are formed where observed,
and “could not have come from the
pericardial cells, which have their own
structure and their special function,”
these cells being very large and characteristic.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Kowalevsky’s preparations of
Truxalis, the pericardial cells with
deposits of carmine and the groups of
leucocytes (Fig. 385, <i>l</i> and <i>l′</i>) stained
with India ink, we have to deal with
elements absolutely different. If the
formation of leucocytes was caused by
the pericardial cells, these last would
be obliged to free themselves from
their contents and to modify their
essential nature.</p>

  <h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> The œnocytes</h4>

<div  class='figright id018'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>These cells (Fig. 386), with the exception of the eggs, are the
largest in the body, and occur in most if not all winged insects.
They were called <i>œnocytes</i> (<i>oinos</i>, wine; <i>kustis</i>, cyst), by Wielowiejski
in allusion to their wine-yellow color. These cells are arranged
segmentally (Fig. 387) in clusters, held in place by tracheæ, and are
situated mostly on each side of the abdomen,
rarely being found in the adjoining
parts of the thorax. They are more
or less intimately associated with the blood
and fat-body. Unlike the fat-body, however,
they arise in embryonic life from the
ectoderm, either by delamination or by
immigration, just behind the tracheal involutions.</p>

<p class='c013'>The separate cells of each cluster are usually
separate, but in rare cases may fuse in pairs or
form smaller clusters. In shape they are round
or oval, often sending out pseudopodia-like processes, by which they are
attached to the tracheal twigs or to each other. “The cytoplasm, which is very
abundant, is full of yellowish granules and is sometimes radially situated
towards its periphery. The large spherical or oval nucleus contains a densely
wound and delicate chromatic filament.” (Wheeler.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Graber first pointed out the identity of these clusters of cells with certain
metameric cell-masses in insect embryos, observed by Tichomiroff in those of
the silkworm, and by Korotneff in the embryo mole-cricket.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although they resemble the blood corpuscles in some insects, they are always
much larger, and do not seem to be amœboid, while they are never seen to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>undergo self-division, or to exhibit any appearance of giving rise to the blood-cells
(Wheeler). They have not yet been detected in Thysanura (Synaptera)
or in Myriopoda.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The phosphorescent organs</h4>

<p class='c016'>Phosphorescence is not infrequent in the Protozoa, cœlenterates,
worms, and has been observed in the bivalve Pholas, in a few abyssal
Crustacea, in myriopods (Geophilus), in an ascidian, Pyrosoma, and
in certain deep-sea fishes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In insects luminosity is mostly confined to a few Coleoptera, and
besides the well-known fireflies, an Indian Buprestid (<i>Buprestis ocelata</i>)
is said to be phosphorescent; also a telephorid larva. Other
luminous insects are the Poduran Anurophorus, Fulgora, certain
Diptera (<i>Culex</i>, <i>Chironomus</i><a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and <i>Tyreophora</i>), and an ant (Orya).</p>

<p class='c007'>The seat of the light is the intensely luminous areas situated either
in the head (Fulgora), in the abdomen (Lampyridæ), or in the thorax
(in a few Elateridæ of the genus Pyrophorus). The luminous or
photogenic organ is regarded by Wielowiejski and also by Emery as
morphologically a specialized portion of the fat-body, being a plate
consisting of polygonal cells, situated directly under the integument,
and supplied with nerves and fine tracheal branches.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Luciola as well as in other fireflies, including Pyrophorus, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>phosphorescent organ or plate consists, as first stated by Kölliker, of
two layers lying one over the other, a dorsal one (Fig. 388, <i>d</i>) which
is opaque, chalky white, and non-photogenic, and a lower one (<i>v</i>),
the active photogenic layer, which is transparent. Through the
upper or opaque layer and on its dorsal surface extend large tracheæ
and their horizontal branches, from which arise numerous very fine
branches which pass down perpendicularly into the transparent or
photogenic layer of the organ. Each tracheal stem, together with
its short branches, is enveloped by a cylindrical mass of transparent
tissue, so that only the short terminal branches or very fine tracheal
capillaries project on the upper part of the cylinder. These finest
tracheal capillaries are not in Luciola filled with air, but with a colorless
fluid, as was also found by Wielowiejski and others in Lampyris.</p>

<p class='c007'>These transparent cylinders, with the tracheæ within, forming
longitudinal axes, resemble lobules. These lobules are so distributed
that they appear on a surface section of this plate as numerous round
areas in which circular periphery the tracheal capillaries are arranged
with the axially disposed tracheal end-cells. These “tracheal end-cells”
are only membranous enlargements at the base of the tracheal
capillaries (Wielowiejski). The cylindrical lobules are separated
from each other by a substance consisting of abundant large granular
cells (parenchym cells) among which project the tracheal capillaries.
The cylindrical lobules extend to the hypodermis and come in contact
only by their lateral faces with the parenchym.</p>

<p class='c007'>The structure of the upper opaque chalky white layer of the phosphorescent
organ is, compared with that of the photogenic lower portion,
very simple. In its loose, pappose, mass are no cellular elements,
but when treated with different reagents it is seen to be filled
with countless urate granules (guanine) swimming in the fluid it contains,
the cell plasma appearing to be dissolved, the cells having lost
their cohesion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In comparing the phosphorescent plate or organ of Luciola with
that of Lampyris, the general structure, including the clear cell elements
of the cylindrical lobules, which envelop the perpendicular
tracheal twigs and their branches, and also the granular parenchymatous
cells are alike in both, though the arrangement and distribution
of the elements in Luciola is more regular, in Lampyris the
tracheal stems being irregularly scattered through the parenchym.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wielowiejski found in the larval and female Lampyris a higher
degree of differentiation than in the male, and Luciola has a more
differentiated photogenic organ than Lampyris, as seen in the more
regular structure of the lobules.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>As regards the light-apparatus of Pyrophorus, or the cucujo, Heinemann
shows that, as in the Lampyridæ, it consists of distinct cells,
and may be regarded as a glandular structure. It is rich in tracheæ
and the other parts already described. In still later researches on a
Brazilian Pyrophorus Wielowiejski shows that the phosphorescent
plate consists of two layers, the upper usually being filled with crystalline
urate concretions, and entirely like those of the Lampyridæ,
consisting of distinct polygonal cells, among which are numerous
tracheal stems, with tænidia, coursing in different directions, when
freshly filled with air, and sending capillaries into the underlying
photogenic layer. The latter shows in its structure a striking difference
in the cellular arrangement from that of Lampyrids. In the
upper or non-photogenic layer are tracheal capillaries which pass
down into the underlying cellular plate and which are in the closest
possible relations with the single cells—a point overlooked by Heinemann.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Physiology of the phosphorescence.</b>—As is well known, the phosphorescence
of animals is a scintillating or glowing light emitted by
various forms, the greenish light or luminous appearance thus produced
being photogenic, <i>i.e.</i> without sensible heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Langley rates the light of the firefly at an efficiency of 100 per
cent, all its radiations lying within the limits of the visible spectrum.
“Langley has shown that while only 2.4 per cent of luminous
waves are contained in the radiation of a gas-flame, only 10 per
cent in that of the electric arc, and only 35 per cent in that of the
sun, the radiation of the firefly (<i>Pyrophorus noctilucus</i>) consists
wholly of visible wave-frequencies.” (Barker’s Physics, p. 385.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The spectrum of the light of the cucujo was found by Pasteur to
be continuous. (C. R. French Acad. Sc. 1864, ii, p. 509.) A later
examination by Aubert and Dubois showed that the spectrum of the
light examined by the spectroscope is very beautiful, but destitute
of dark bands. When, however, the intensity diminishes, the red
and orange disappear, and the green and yellow only remain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heinemann studied the cucujo at Vera Cruz, Mexico. At night in
a dark room it radiates a pale green light which shows a blue tone to
the exclusion of any other light. The more gas or lamp light there
is present, the more apparent becomes the yellowish green hue, which
in clear daylight changes to an almost pure very light yellow with a
very slight mixture of green. “In the morning and evening twilight,
more constantly and clearly in the former, the cucujo light, at
least to my eyes, is an intensely brilliant yellow with a slight mixture
of red. In a dark room lighted with a sodium light the yellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>tone entirely disappears; on the other hand, the blue strikingly increases.”
As regards the spectrum he found that almost exactly
half of the blue end is wanting and that the red part is also a little
narrower than in the spectrum of the petroleum flame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor C. A. Young states that the spectrum given by our common
firefly (<i>Photinus?</i>) is perfectly continuous, without trace of lines
either bright or dark. “It extends from a little above Fraunhofer’s
line C, in the scarlet, to about F in the blue, gradually fading out at
the extremities. It is noticeable that precisely this portion of the
spectrum is composed of rays which, while they more powerfully than
any others affect the organs of vision, produce hardly any thermal
or actinic effect. In other words, very little of the energy expended
in the flash of the fire is wasted. It is quite different with our artificial
methods of illumination. In the case of an ordinary gaslight
the best experiments show that not more than one or two per cent
of the radiant energy consists of <i>visible rays</i>; the rest is either invisible
heat or actinism; that is to say, over 98 per cent of the gas is
wasted in producing rays that do not help in making objects visible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Panceri also remarks that while in the spectroscope the light of
some Chætopteri, Beroë, and Pyrosoma exhibit one broad band like
that given by monochromatic light, that of Lampyris and Luciola is
polychromatic. (Amer. Nat., vii, 1873, p. 314.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The filtered rays of Lampyris pass (like Röntgen and uranium
rays) through aluminium (Muraoka).</p>

<p class='c007'>The physiology of insect phosphorescence is thus briefly stated by
Lang: “The cells of this luminous organ secrete, under the control of
the nervous system, a substance which is burnt during the appearance
of the light; this combustion takes place by means of the oxygen conveyed
to the cells of the luminous body by the tracheæ, which branch
profusely in it and break up into capillaries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Emery states that the males of Luciola display their light in two
ways. When at night time they are active or flying, the light is given
out at short and regular intervals, causing the well-known sparkling
or scintillating light. If we catch a flying Luciola or pull apart one
resting in the day time, or cut off its hind body, it gives out a tolerably
strong light, though not nearly reaching the intensity of the
light waves of the sparkling light. In this case the light is constant,
yet we notice, especially in the wounded insect, that the phosphorescent
plate in its whole extent is not luminous, but glows at different
places as if phosphorescent clouds passed over it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is self-evident that a microscopic observation of the light of the
glow-worm or firefly is not possible, but an animal while giving out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>its light, or a separated abdomen, may readily be placed under the
microscope and observed under tolerably high powers. By making
the experiment in a rather dark room Emery saw clear shining rings
on a dark background. “All the rings are not equally lighted.
Comparing this with the results of anatomical investigation, it
is seen that the rings of light correspond with the previously described
circular tracheal capillaries, <i>i.e.</i> the limits between the
tracheal-cell cylinder and the parenchym-cells. The parenchym-cells
are never stained of a deep brown; this proves that its plasma
may be the seat of the light-producing oxidation. Hence this process
of oxidation takes place in the upper surface of the parenchym-cells,
but outside of their own substance. The parenchym-cells in
reality secrete the luminous matter; this is taken up by the tracheal
end-cells and burnt or oxidized by means of the oxygen present in
the tracheal capillaries. Such a combustion can only take place
when the chitinous membrane of the tracheæ is extraordinarily fine
and easily penetrable, as is the case in the capillaries of the photogenic
plate; therefore the plasma of the tracheal cells only oxidizes
at the forking of the terminal tracheal twigs and in the capillaries.”
(Emery.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The color of the light of Luciola is identical in the two sexes, and
the intensity is much the same, though that of the female is more restricted.
The rhythm of the flashes of light given out by the male
is more rapid, and the flashes briefer, while those of the female are
longer, more tremulous, and appear at longer intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emery then asks: What is the use of this luminosity? Is it only
to allure the females of Luciola, which are so much rarer than the
males? Contrary to the general view that it is an alluring act, he
thinks that phosphorescence is a means of defence, or a warning or
danger-signal against insectivorous nocturnal animals. If we dissect
or crush a Luciola, it gives out a disagreeable cabbage-like smell, and
perhaps this is sufficient to render it inedible to bats or other nocturnal
animals. An acrid taste they certainly do not possess.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has long been known that the eggs of fireflies, both Lampyridæ
and Pyrophorus, are luminous. Both Newport and more recently
Wielowiejski attributes the luminosity not to the contents of the
egg, but to the portions of the fat-body cells or fluid covering on the
outside of the eggs, due to ruptures of the parts within the body of
the female during oviposition. The larvæ at different ages are also
luminous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position of the luminous organs changes with age. In the
larvæ of Pyrophorus before moulting, according to Dubois, the luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>organs are situated only on the ventral side of the head and
prothoracic segment. In larvæ of the second stage there are added
three shining spots on each of the first eight abdominal segments,
and a single luminous spot on the last segment. These spots are
arranged in a linear series and thus form three luminous cords. In
the adult beetles there is a luminous spot in the middle of the first
abdominal sternite, but the greatest amount of light is produced by
the two vesicles on the hinder part of the prothorax, the position of
which varies according to the species.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>While land vertebrates breathe by inhaling the air through the
mouth into the lungs, insects respire by internal air-tubes (<i>tracheæ</i>),
which ramify throughout every part of the body and its appendages.
The air enters these tubes through a few openings, called spiracles
or <i>stigmata</i>, arranged segmentally in the sides of the body. These
tracheæ are everywhere bathed by the blood, and thus the latter is
constantly aërated or kept fresh; the blood not, as in vertebrates
or as in molluscs, seeking the lungs or gills, or any specialized
respiratory portion of the body where the oxygen combines with the
hæmoglobin, but the respiratory tubes, so to speak, themselves seek
out the blood and the blood-tissue in every part of the insect body,
penetrating to the tips of the antennæ and of the legs, entering the
most delicate tissues, even perhaps passing through the walls of
epithelial cells. As Lang remarks, the want of an arterial vascular
system is compensated for as well as conditioned by the extremely
profuse branching of the tracheæ.</p>

<div  class='figleft id030'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 389.</span>—Rat-tailed larva of Eristalis.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The aquatic larvæ of certain dragon-flies (Agrionidæ), may-flies,
case-worms, etc., respire by means of tracheal gills or branchiæ,
which are either filamental or leaf-like appendages
containing tracheæ. Somewhat similar
structures appended to the thorax of pupal
aquatic Diptera, as in the mosquito and its
allies, enable them to breathe while stationed
a little beneath the surface of the water.
Other larvæ, as the rat-tail larva of Eristalis, etc., lying at the
bottom of shallow pools or in ditches, etc., can breathe by raising
slightly above the surface a long appendage with two spiracles at the
end, through which the air enters the tracheal system. (See p. 461.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Aristotle, as well as the natural philosophers of the
Middle Ages, supposed that insects did not breathe, one can easily
see that they do by holding a grasshopper or dragon-fly in one’s
hand and observing the rhythmical rise and fall of the upper
and lower walls of the abdomen, during which the air enters and
passes out of the air-openings or spiracles on each side of the
body.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that insects consume very little air, since caterpillars
may be confined in very small, almost air-tight tin boxes, and continue
to eat and undergo their transformations without suffering
from the confinement. According to H. Müller an insect placed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>a small, confined space absorbs all the oxygen. Insects can survive
for many hours when placed in an exhausted receiver, or in certain
irrespirable gases. “Cockroaches in carbonic acid speedily become
insensible, but after twelve hours’ exposure to the pure gas they
survive and appear none the worse.” (Miall
and Denny, p. 165.) Insects of the
swiftest flight breathe most rapidly, their
great muscular activity requiring the absorption
of an abundance of oxygen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>It will much simplify our conception of
the nature of the air-tubes when we learn
that they originate in the embryo as tubular ingrowths of the
integument (ectoderm), these branching and finally reaching every
part of the interior of the body. They are elastic tubes, and being
filled with air are silvery in
color, though at their origin
near the spiracles they are reddish
or violet bluish; or, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>the larva of Æschna, reddish brown, this tint being due to a
finely granular pigment situated in the peritoneal membrane.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In their essential structure the tracheæ consist
of the chitinous intima, which is a continuation
of the cuticle of the integument, and of a cellular
membrane or outer layer of cells (a continuation
of the hypodermis) called the peritoneal membrane,
or ectotrachea (Figs. 392, 393).</p>

<p class='c007'>Leydig discovered that the spiral filaments
are not distinct and separate, but intimately connected
with the inner membrane (intima), and he
detected the outer or peritoneal membrane, which
Chun afterwards found to be epithelial in its
nature, Minot stating that it is a true pavement
epithelium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Figure 393 represents a longitudinal section of
a large trachea of Hydrophilus, showing the
peritoneal membrane (<i>ectotrachea</i>, <i>ep</i>) and the

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Distribution of the tracheæ.</b>—The distribution of the air-tubes, as
Lubbock and also Minot state, depends first upon the shape of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>organs, and upon the size of those whose size is variable. Around
the large, hollow organs (digestive canal, sexual organs) the tracheæ
ramify in all directions, forking so that the branches diverge at a
wide angle. In the organs which have muscular walls, like the
oviduct, the tracheæ run straight when the walls are distended, but
have a sinuous course when the walls are contracted. (Minot.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“Around the organs of more elongated form the branches of the tracheæ run
more longitudinally, as is shown by the air-tubes of the muscles, which also present
some peculiarities worthy of especial notice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A short, thick trunk arrives at the muscular bundle, and dividing very
rapidly, breaks up into a large number of delicate tubes, which penetrate between
the muscular fibres, then terminating in tubes of exceeding fineness, which
at first sight seem to form a network that might well be called a <i>rete mirabile</i>.
A closer examination, however, reveals that it is not a real network, but rather
an interlacing confusing to the eye. The longitudinal direction of the tracheæ
of the muscles presents a striking contrast to the system of divarication represented
in Figs. 13 and 14. The course of the tracheæ of the Malpighian tubes is
also very curious. There is one large trachea which winds around the tube in a
long spiral, giving off numerous small branches which run to the surface of the
tube, upon which they form delicate ramifications. Each tube has but a single
main trachea, and I think the trachea continues the whole length of the tube,
but of this last point I am not quite sure.” (Minot.)</p>

<p class='c007'>While in the nymphs of Orthoptera the tracheæ very closely resemble
those of the adult, in larvæ of insects with a complete metamorphosis
the tracheæ differ very much in distribution from those
of the adult. The larval tracheæ are also more generalized and
more like those of the original type than the tracheæ of perfect insects.
(Lubbock.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In general there are two main tracheæ, one passing along each
side of the body, near the digestive canal, connected with its mate
by a few transverse anastomosing branches, and sending off a branch
to each spiracle, this arrangement being most simple and apparent
in the maggots of Diptera. From these two main branches smaller
twigs branch off into every part of the body with its appendages,
passing among the different organs, often serving as cables to hold
them loosely in place; they also penetrate into the component parts
of the organ themselves, passing into the fat-bodies, and among the
fibres of muscles, where they become finely attenuated and refined
like the capillaries of the vascular system of vertebrates. (Figs.
395, 396.)</p>

be 0.0016 mm. (Zeits. f. Wiss. Zool. xlix, 1890, p. 575.) Weismann states that
in the larvæ of Corethra and Chironomus the tracheal system is only incompletely
developed; the tracheæ are not united with each other, and in the youngest
larvæ they do not contain air.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Each of the two main tracheæ, as Kolbe states,
sends off into each segment of the body three
branches.</p>

<p class='c013'>1. An upper or dorsal branch, which supplies the
muscles of the dorsal region.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. A middle (visceral) branch, whose twigs pass
to the digestive canal and back to the organs of
reproduction.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. A lower (ventral) branch, whose twigs are
distributed to the ganglia and to the muscles of the
ventral region.</p>

<p class='c013'>In certain Thysanura, as a species of Machilis
(Fig. 397), we probably have the primitive condition
of the tracheal system, the longitudinal and transverse
anastomoses being absent, but in other Thysanura
(Japyx, Nicoletia, Lepisma, and a few species
of Machilis) they are present.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Kolbe remarks, whether the fine ends of the
tracheæ are closed or open, whether after the analogy
of the blood capillaries of vertebrates they anastomose
with each other, whether the ends of the air-tubes
pass between the cells or penetrate into them, these
questions are not fully settled. According to Leydig’s<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
latest views the tracheæ penetrate into the cells
and unite with the hyaloplasma. Hence the process
of respiration in the last instance takes place in the
hyaloplasma. This assumption accords with the fact
that in the tracheate Arthropods the terminations of
the tracheæ carry the atmospheric air into the space
bounded by the cellular network, also to the hyaloplasma
filling the spaces. Leydig<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a> also thinks that
the finest tracheal endings penetrate into the muscular
tissue and unite with the primitive muscular fibres.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kupffer is likewise of the opinion that the
fine tracheæ penetrate into the cells, and Lidth
de Jeude asserts that they enter the epithelial cells, “each cell containing several
branches.” Kölliker, Emery, etc., maintain, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>that the tracheal endings lie between the cells. Wielowiejski,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
in describing the line tracheæ of the phosphorescent organs, thinks
that the tracheal endings (tracheal capillaries) rarely end blindly,
but anastomose with one another, forming an irregular network.
The latest observer, Gilson (1893), asserts that tracheal twigs penetrate
deeply into the epithelial cells of the silk glands of larval
Trichoptera as well as of caterpillars, passing through their protoplasm.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A late investigator, C. von Wistinghausen, finds in the tracheæ of the spinning-glands
of caterpillars a completely formed network between the terminal
branches of two or several tracheal groups. The tracheal tubes of this series of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>terminal branches pass into this network, which he calls the tracheal capillary
end-network (Figs. 398, 400). This last varies in thickness and spreads out under
the membrana propria of the glandular mass over the entire surface of the large
gland-cells and on a level with the tracheal capillaries. The tracheal endings do
not penetrate into the cells, but are separated from the plasma of the cells by a
thin membrane. The tracheal capillary end-network appears as a system of fine
tubes like the tracheal capillaries, consisting of a peritoneal layer and a chitinous
intima (Fig. 400). The walls of these tubes are homogeneous, not porous,
though readily permeable by the parenchymatous fluid. The interchange of
gases consequently may go on easier and more vigorously in a system of richly
anastomosing tubules of the net-like mass of tracheal capillaries, than in tubes
ending blindly.</p>

<p class='c013'>While the diameter of the tracheal capillaries is 0.0016 mm. or 1 µ, that of the
tubules composing the tracheal capillary end-network is scarcely measurable,
but is less than 1 µ.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>These tracheal capillaries also occur on the seminal and other sexual tubes, on
the intestine, on the urinary tubes, on the fat-bodies, but are most easily detected
on the silk-glands.</p>

<p class='c013'>The latest researches are those of E. Holmgren, who has studied the branching
of the tracheæ in the spinning-glands of caterpillars. He prefers to call the
end-cells “transition cells,” as they lead from the tracheal tubes proper to the
capillary network. This latter is formed by slender nucleated cells, often with
an intracellular lumen, and, according to the author, probably constituting a respiratory
epithelium. He finds that both large and small tracheæ may penetrate
the gland-cells. (Anat. Anzeiger, xi, 1895, pp. 340–6, 3 figs.; Jour. Roy. Micr.
Soc., 1896, p. 182.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The spiracles or stigmata</h4>

<p class='c016'>The spiracles are segmentally arranged openings in the sides of
the thorax and abdomen, through which the air passes into the air-tubes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>In its essential structure a spiracle, or <i>stigma</i>, is a slit-like
opening surrounded by a chitinous ring, the lips or edges of the
opening being membranous and closed by
a movable valve of the spiracle attached
by its lower edge, which is closed by an
occlusor muscle (Fig. 401). The aperture
when open forms a narrow oval slit;
and in most insects the slit is within
guarded by a row of projecting spines or
setæ, which form a lattice work or grate
to keep out dust, dirt, fluids, etc.</p>

those of the Synaptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>I. <i>Stigmata without lips</i> (Primitive or generalized
stigmata).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>a.</i> The simplest stigma is an aperture which
is kept open by a chitinous ring (Acanthia). The opening may be round or
elliptical. There are no lips nor any movement of the edges to be observed.
Such air-holes occur in the abdomen of bugs (Hemiptera) and beetles (Coleoptera);
within the opening of the stigmata in the same insects is a funnel-like
contraction. Also in the Diptera the abdominal stigmata are of the same type.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
The stigmata of the Pulicidae (Siphonaptera) are more complicated, as the
edges of the openings are provided
with setæ (Fig. 402).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>b.</i> The stigma consists of a series of minute single stigmata, which are usually
surmounted by a common chitinous ring, and whose tubular continuations unite
within in a common trachea, so that the single tubes pass off from the stigma
like the fingers on the hand. This form is found in the larvæ and puparia of
Diptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>II. <i>Stigmata with lips</i> (Secondary more specialized stigmata).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>c.</i> The lips are represented by a single chitinous ring, with sparse spines.
One side of the stigma is a little higher, and partly overlaps the other posteriorly;
this form is peculiar to the Orthoptera and Libellulidae.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>d.</i> The lips are roof-like, bent inwards and densely hairy, forming a peculiar
kind of felting. The setæ of the lips are in most beetles and many Lepidoptera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>separate, and more or less branched. In caterpillars, the setæ are so finely
branched as to form a loose felt, or sieve-like arrangement.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>e.</i> The stigmata are round, with a very broad border and a concentric middle
portion, the structure being complicated. The concentric middle portion is
pouch-like and bears the occlusor muscle. This form occurs in the larvæ of
lamellicorn beetles, and can be seen with the naked eye, or with a lens, in
Oryctes, Cetonia, and Melolontha (Fig. 403).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>f.</i> Over the outer opening of the spiracle is an incurved chitinous projection,
on one side of which the trachea takes its origin. It is thus in the Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>The remarkable grate-like stigma of the lamellicorn larvæ has the appearance
as if the outer closing plate or valve were impenetrable. The earlier observers
considered these stigmata to be open, but Meinert regards them as closed;
Schiödte, however, has observed by pressing a preserved specimen of a Melolontha
larva the alcohol within passing out in drops, through the grate-like plate,
and hence he considers this a proof that the stigma is permeable (Kolbe).</p>

<p class='c013'>More recently (1893) Boas has examined the same structure in the same
species of larva as examined by Schiödte, and he finds it to be open only during
the process of moulting. He finds that on each side of the larva there are nine
short and wide stigmatic branches, each of which is shut off from the exterior by
a brown plate; this consists of a reniform sieve-plate, and of a curved bulla
which fits into the cavity of the plate. The stigmatic branch, however, is provided
with a large external opening, which is homologous with the stigma, but
which is usually closed by the plate and bulla, and is only open during the moulting;
at first it is circular, but later becomes a cleft. A transverse section shows
that the bulla is a simple tegumentary fold, the outer chitinous layer of which
has become especially firm. The plate forms a horizontal half-roof, which
springs from one side of the tracheal orifice, and is supported by obliquely set
bases, which spring from the adjoining part of the inner side of the tracheæ.
The plate and bars are purely cuticular structures. (Zool. Anz., 1893; also
Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc., p. 54.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The tracheal system of libellulid nymphs is not closed; on the other hand,
in the fully-grown nymphs the anterior stigmata occurring on the dorsal side are
large, and the tracheæ arising from them are thick. These stigmata are permeable
by the air. In half-grown and still younger stages of Æschna the two anterior
thoracic stigmata are undeveloped. In order to breathe, the fully-grown
nymph either rises up on the upper side and elevates the end of the body to the
surface in order to take the air into the rectum, or it rests with the back of the
thorax at the surface in order to breathe through the large stigmata. The young
nymphs take in air only through the rectum. The young nymphs of Libellula
and its allies, on the other hand, possess large thoracic stigmata, but they prefer
to breathe through the rectum. The fully-grown nymphs of Agrion breathe
through the thoracic stigmata. (Dewitz, in Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The position and number of pairs of stigmata.</b>—The spiracles are
usually situated in the soft membrane between the tergites and
pleurites, but their exact position varies in different groups. In the
Coleoptera they occupy on the thorax a more ventral position, and
on the abdomen are placed near the edge of the dorsal side, under
the elytra. In the dragon-flies, the first pair is situated much more
dorsally than the second and third pairs; the following seven pairs
are almost wholly ventral and lie concealed in the membranous fold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>near the external plate. In the Hemiptera, also, the abdominal stigmata,
though entirely free and visible, are situated ventrally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Primarily, in the embryo a pair of stigmata appear on each segment
of the thorax and abdomen, except the 10th and 11th, and
even possibly in the head, for a pair of stigmata are said to occur in
the head of Podurids (Smynthurus) (Lubbock), though this statement
needs confirmation. Scolopendrella, however, is known to possess
a pair of cephalic spiracles.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the foregoing statement it will be seen that while in existing
winged insects no more than 10 (in Japyx 11) pairs of stigmata
are to be found in any one species, yet that 12 segments of the
body, in different groups taken collectively, bear them. The primitive
number of pairs of spiracles, therefore, in winged insects, was 12,
<i>i.e.</i> a pair in each thoracic segment, and a pair in each of the first
nine abdominal segments. Insects were originally all holopneustic,
and gradually as the type became differentiated into the different
orders they became peripneustic or amphipneustic, and, in certain
aquatic forms, apneustic. (See pp. 459, 461.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the still more primitive, probably wingless, ancestors of insects
there was a larger number of stigmata. Hatschek, in 1877, discovered
a pair of tracheal invaginations in each of the three posterior
head-segments of the embryo of a moth, with stigmatal openings
in the 1st and 2d maxillary segments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus early in embryonic life every segment of the body, except
those bearing the eyes and the last abdominal, bore a pair of stigmata,
so that the primitive insect had at least 15, and perhaps more,
pairs of stigmata.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position of the stigmata is subject to much variation, the
result of adaptation to this or that mode of life. Examples are
those insects which live in dusty situations or usually more or less
concealed in the earth, as in most beetles, and in the Hymenoptera.
In such beetles, the stigmata are situated in the thin membrane
between the segments; in the Hymenoptera, on the upper edge of
the segments. In the Siphonaptera, Pediculina, bed-bug, and similar
forms, which breathe an air freer from dust, the spiracles lie free on
the outside of the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the stigmata are free and without any protection on the abdomen,
there are other ways by which the entrance of foreign bodies into the tracheæ is
prevented. In such cases the body is covered with dense hairs, as in most Diptera
and Neuroptera, as well as many Lepidoptera; or there is situated in front
of the stigma either a small fissure which is covered over by a number of hairs
arising from the edge, as in many Orthoptera; or, as in most insects, a luxurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>growth of hairs on the inside of the stigma forms a thick filter for the air. Thus
we see that also in this respect each species of insect is completely adapted to its
surroundings.” (Krancher.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The closing apparatus of the stigma.</b>—Whether the external opening
of the stigma is permanently open or closed, communication with
the tracheæ may be cut off at pleasure during respiration by an internal
apparatus of elastic chitinous bands and rods and the occlusor
muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The parts concerned in this operation are: 1. The closing bow;
2. The closing lever or peg; 3. The closing band; 4. The occlusor
muscle (Figs. 405, 406).</p>

<div  class='figright id025'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“The first three parts are chitinized; they form a ring around the
stigmatic opening, and are united to each other by joints. The bow
is usually crescentic and as a rule surrounds
one-half of the trachea. On the
other side is the closing band which, by
different contrivances, representing the
closing lever or peg, becomes closely
pressed against the closing bow. This
lever is usually of the shape of a
slender chitinous rod, which causes the
closure; but it can also bend rectangularly,
become converted into a typical
lever as in the Lepidoptera, or it may
assume the form of two peg-like processes,
which press with their base
against the closing bow.” (Krancher.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“The closure of the spiracular opening is effected by the contraction
of the muscles, while the opening is due to the elasticity
of the chitinous parts. When at rest the spiracle is naturally open,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>so that the air in the trachea can directly communicate with the
external air. Usually one end of the muscle is attached to the closing
peg, and the other end to the closing bow. Where, as in Melolontha,
the closing apparatus is provided with two levers, then naturally
the muscle binds these two together and brings about by
powerful contractions a firm closure of the trachea”; but, remarks
Krancher, “this is not the only kind; there are numerous modifications.
Besides the form just described, the levers assume the form
of valves (Sirex), or of a brush (Pulex); or of a ring (larvæ of
Diptera) with a circular muscle attached to it; or of a ring which
simply becomes compressed (thoracic stigmata of Diptera).”</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Morphology and homologies of the tracheal system</h4>

<p class='c016'>As first shown by Bütschli, the tracheal system is a series of segmentally
arranged tubular invaginations of the ectoderm; a pair of
stigmata primitively occurring on every segment of the body except
perhaps the most anterior, and the last two or last one, a reduction
in their number having since taken place, until in the Podurans none
have survived. In the supposed ancestor of myriopods and insects,
Peripatus, there are tracheæ; but they are very fine, simple, not-branched
chitinous tubes which are united into tufts at the base of
a flask-shaped depression of the integument, the outer aperture of
which depression is regarded as a stigma. In one species (<i>P. edwardsii</i>)
these tufts and their openings are scattered irregularly over
the body; but in another kind (<i>P. capensis</i>) some of the stigmata at
least show traces of a serial arrangement, being disposed in longitudinal
rows—two on each side, one dorsally and one ventrally,
those of each row, however, being more numerous than the pairs of
legs. (See p. 9 and Fig. 4, <i>D</i>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be observed that in Peripatus, which does not possess
urinary tubes, the segmental organs or nephridia are well developed,
hence the tracheal tubes coexisting with them cannot be their homologues.
We are therefore compelled to regard the tracheal system
as of independent origin, arising in the earliest terrestrial air-breathing
arthropod, and not indebted for its origin to any structure found
in worms, unless perhaps, as both Kennell and Lang suggest, to
dermal glands, since, according to Kennell, certain Hirudinea and
many Turbellarian worms possess long, mostly unicellular, glands
which spread far through the parenchyma of the body. (Kennell.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus Kennell supposes that the ancestors of the Tracheates had spiracles on
every segment of the body where the internal organization allowed them to exist.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>“The reduction of the breathing holes to a smaller number, and their restriction
of a pair only to a single segment, was brought about partly by adaptation to a
peculiar mode of life,—as insect larvæ especially teach us,—partly also—I may
say mechanically—as a result of the obstruction to their development made by
the growth or excessive development of other organs.” Among these he reckons
the thick, dense cuticula of the integument, the internal fusion of several segments
to form body-regions, and the arrangement and great development of the
muscles in the head and thorax, etc. (p. 29.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Kennell has suggested the origin of the tracheæ of Peripatus from the unicellular
dermal glands of annelidan ancestors, since he has found glands in certain
land-leaches of tropical America, which are provided with enormously long tubular
passages united into bundles and opening externally, these tubes appearing
to be slightly chitinized. Fig. 407 will show the appearance of a bundle of fine
tracheal tubes of Peripatus ending at the bottom of a follicle formed by a deep
invagination of the integument, which may be regarded as a primitive spiracle.
(See Kennell, Ueber einige Landblutegel des tropical America, Zool. Jahrb. ii,
1886; also Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der Arthropoden, 1891, p. 25.) We
may add that Carrière supposes from his study of the embryology of the wall-bee
(<i>Chalicodoma muraria</i>), published in 1890, that not only the salivary glands, but
also the tentorium, are homologues of the tracheæ, while other structures than
tracheæ may have evolved from
unicellular dermal glands, which
are widely distributed. It may
in this connection be observed
that some authors derive the
book-lungs or book-leaf tracheæ
of Arachnida from the gills of
Limulus; hence if those of
Arachnida arose from quite different
and more specialized
organs than dermal glands, it is
not impossible that the tracheæ
of Peripatus, Myriopods, and
insects arose <i>de novo</i>, and then
we need not look for any primitive
structures in worms from
which they arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although Bütschli in 1870 in
his embryology of the honey-bee
called attention to the “great
similarity which the eleven pairs
of invaginations in the eleven
first trunk-segments in their first indication (<i>anlage</i>) have with the spinning-glands,
and also with the segmental organs of Annelids,” he did not go further
than this, and it is now known that in the 2d maxillary segment open not only
spinning-glands, but in the embryo a pair of stigmata.</p>

<p class='c013'>Paul Mayer, however, regarded the tracheæ and urinary tubes as homodynamous
structures, and this view was advocated by Grassi (1885) for the reason
that while in the embryo honey-bee there are ten pairs of stigmata, the first
thoracic and two last abdominal segments wanting them, the germs of the urinary
tubes arise in a corresponding situation on the two last abdominal segments.
To this view Emery (Biol. Centralb., 1886, p. 692) objects that in Peripatus the
nephridia and tracheæ “have nothing to do with the segmental organs,” as Peripatus
besides nephridia possesses both coxal glands and tracheæ.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>Both Kennell and Lang derive the coxal glands of Arthropoda from the setiparous
or parapodial glands of annelid worms, and the recent endeavor of Bernard
to show that the tracheæ arose from setiparous glands seems to be disproved by
the fact that in insects as well as in other Arthropoda coxal glands with their
outlets exist in the same segments as those bearing stigmata. Reasoning by
exclusion, we are led to regard Kennell’s original view as the soundest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Patten, however, regards the tracheæ as modified ends of nephridia, remarking:
“Since in Acilius some of the abdominal tracheæ at first communicate with
the cavities of the mesoblastic somites, it is probable that all the tracheæ represent
the ectodermic portions of the nephridia.” (Origin of Vertebrates from
Arachnids, p. 355.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable, therefore, that the tracheæ first arose as modifications
of dermal glands, as in mites and Peripatus, and that at first
they were not provided with tænidia (as in Chilopoda), while in later
forms tænidia were developed. In the earliest tracheate forms the
stigmata were not segmentally arranged, probably appearing irregularly
anywhere in the body, but afterwards in the myriopods and
insects became serially arranged.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The spiral threads or tænidia</h4>

<p class='c016'>It is generally supposed that the so-called “spiral thread” forms
a continuous thread from one end of a tracheal branch to the other.
This was first shown not to be the case by Platner in 1844. Minot
has proved that “there is not a single spiral thread, but several,
which run parallel to one another and end after making a few turns
around the trachea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tænidia we have found to be in some cases separate, independent,
solid rings, though when there is more than one turn the
thread necessarily becomes spiral. The tænidia of a main branch
stop at the origin of the smaller branches, and a new set begins at
the origin of each branch. The tænidia at the origin of the branch
do not pass entirely around the inside of the peritoneal membrane;
in the axils they are short, separate, spindle-shaped bands (Fig. 409).</p>

<p class='c013'>At one point in the main trachea of the larva of Datana the tænidia were
seen to end singly on one side (at a considerable distance from any branch or
axil) at intervals, with a tænidium situated between them, making four or five
turns; then there is only one band situated between two ends; this band or
thread is succeeded by a set with five turns between the two ends, this set being
succeeded by one complete ring situated between two ends; in all cases the ends
vary in length, some threads being short and others long, so that they apparently
end anywhere along the circumference of the trachea, and this arrangement is
seen to apparently extend along the whole length of the trachea. Hence it is
seen that as a rule the tænidia vary much in length, and never, as generally
supposed, pass continuously from one end to another of a tracheal branch, for
there are many spirals in a branch, each making only from one to five turns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>most usually four turns. Fig. 408, part of a trachea of <i>Dyticus marginatus</i>,
shows that at a slight bend in a trachea the tænidia is interrupted, and short,
incomplete, wedge-shaped tænidia (<i>e</i>) are interpolated; at <i>A</i>, <i>d</i> is seen a split
in one of the tænidia (compare also
MacLeod, Pl. 1, Fig. 9). The
threads are quite irregular in width.
In the axils of the branches there
is, as seen in Fig. 409, a basketwork
of independent, short, often
spindle-shaped tænidia; these are
succeeded by longer ones, until
we have threads passing entirely
around near the base of each new
branch; these being succeeded by
others which make from two to
five spiral turns.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The shape of the tænidia
appears to vary to a great
extent. In lepidopterous insects
we have observed them
to be in their general shape
rather flat and slightly concavo-convex, the hollow looking towards
the centre of the trachea. Minot’s section (Fig. 393) shows that
in Hydrophilus they are cylindrical and solid, and Chun states
that those of Stratiomys are round, while in Eristalis they are
round, with a ridge projecting into the cavity of the trachea; in
Æschna the thread is quadrangular. MacLeod states that sometimes
it is cylindrical, in other cases flat, likewise prismatic; Macloskie
believes that the spiral threads of the centipede are “fine
tubules, externally opening by a fissure along their course.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Stokes confirms Macloskie’s statements, stating that in the hemipterous
<i>Zaitha fluminea</i> “the tænidia are fissured tubules formed
within and from chitinized folds of the intima, the convexity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>folds looking towards the lumen of the tracheæ.” In Fig. 414, <span class='small'>1</span>,
are represented portions of several tænidia showing the fissure,
which is sometimes interrupted; at <span class='small'>2</span> are seen “the formation of
what may be called apertures in a chitinous bridge.” Stokes regards
the tænidia as “inwardly
directed folds of
the membrane.” Near the
spiracles the tracheal
membrane is externally
studded with minute papillæ,
as shown at <span class='small'>3</span>,
where are represented
three broad and incomplete
tænidia, with the
tapering end, or the beginning,
of another.
Stokes adds, “Here they
are only broad grooves,
with no appearance of
the narrow fissure of the
completed tænidium. At
<span class='small'>4</span> is figured a portion of
the internal surface of a
large trachea near the
external orifice, the tænidia being in an incipient stage, evidently
forming more or less of a network, as is usually the case next to the
stigma” (compare p. 451, and Fig. 414).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The tracheæ of chilopod myriopods appear to be like those of insects. A
number of authors have failed to detect the spiral threads in the Julidæ. As
to the Arachnida, several observers, including Menge and Bertkau, have denied
the existence of the spiral thread in the spiders with the exception of the Attidæ;
and MacLeod finds them “scarcely visible” in Argyroneta.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the tracheæ, the salivary duct is kept permanently distended
by tænidia, which, however, are not spiral. They usually
form incomplete rings, as in Stomoxys, arranged as shown in Fig.
410.</p>

<p class='c007'>The labella (proboscis) of flies are supported by incomplete chitinous
tubes or “pseudo-tracheæ,” the ends of which form the scraping
teeth, this being, according to Dimmock, their primary function.
Dimmock describes them as cylindrical channels opening on the surface
in zigzag slits. These channels are held open by incomplete
rings, one end of which is forked. “These rings are apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>arranged so that one has its fork on one side of the opening of the
channel, the next ring the fork on the opposite side of the channel,
and so on, in alternation. Their true structure
is revealed when flattened out.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The use of the elastic tænidia is to render
the tracheæ elastic, and to keep them permanently
open, as is the case with the
parallel rings of the trachea of the higher
vertebrates. The tracheæ are thus rendered
firm and solid, at the least expense of chitinous
material. The spiral thread, as MacLeod
remarks, “is the realization in nature
of what engineers call a form of the greatest
resistance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The tænidia are wanting in the fine endings of
the tracheæ (tracheal capillaries); also in the cockroach,
according to Miall and Denny, they are not
developed in the large tracheæ close to the spiracles,
and the intima or wall of the tube has a tessellated
instead of a spiral marking (Fig. 411). The same
structure is seen in the Perlidæ (Nemoura, Gerstaecker,
Zeit. f. wissen. Zool. xxiv, Taf. xxiii, Figs.
5 and 7); also in Æschna (Hagen, Zool. Anz. 1880,
p. 159). In certain fine tracheæ of the eyes of the
fly no spiral threads are developed. (Hickson.) The air-sacs or dilated tracheæ
are also without tænidia.</p>

<p class='c007'>While in the living insect the main and smaller tracheæ are filled,
with air, it is stated by Von Wistinghausen that the fine capillary
ends contain a fluid.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>e.</i> Origin of the tracheæ and of the “spiral thread”</h4>

<p class='c016'>While we owe to Bütschli the discovery of the mode of origin
and morphology of the tracheæ, which as he has shown<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> arise by
invaginations of the ectoblast; there being originally a single layer
of epiblastic cells concerned in the formation of the tracheæ; we
are indebted to Weismann<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> for the discovery of the mode of origin of
the “intima,” from the epiblastic layer of cells forming the primitive
foundation of the tracheal structure.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>Weismann did not observe the earliest steps in the process of formation of the
stigma and main trunk of the tracheæ, which Bütschli afterwards clearly described
and figured.</p>

<p class='c013'>Weismann, however, thus describes the mode of development of the intima;
after describing the cells destined to form the peritoneal membrane, he says:
“The lumen is filled with a clear fluid and already shows a definite border in a
slight thickening of the cell-wall next to it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very soon this thickening forms a thin, structureless intima, which passes
as a delicate double line along the cells, and shows its dependence on the cells
by a sort of adherence to the rounded sides of the cells (Taf. vii, 97 <i>A</i>, <i>a b c</i>).
Throughout the mass, as the intima thickens, the cells lose their independence,
their walls pressing together and coalescing, and soon the considerably enlarged
hollow cylinder of the intima is surrounded by a homogeneous layer of a tissue,
whose origin from cells is recognized only by the regular position of the rounded
nuclei (Taf. vii, Fig. 97, <i>B</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then as soon as the wavy bands of the intima entirely disappear, and it
forms a straight, cylindrical tube, a fine pale cross-striation becomes noticeable
(vii, 97, <i>B</i>, <i>int</i>), which forms the well-known ‘spiral thread,’ a structure which,
as Leydig has shown, possesses no independence, but arises merely from a partial
thickening of the originally homogeneous intima.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Meyer’s idea that the spiral threads are fissures in the intima produced by
the entrance of air is disproved by the fact that the spiral threads are present
long before the air enters. Hence the correctness of Leydig’s view, based on
the histological structure of the tracheæ, is confirmed by the embryological development,
and the old idea of three membranes, which both Meyer and Milne-Edwards
maintain, must be given up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Weismann also contends that the elastic membrane bearing the “spiral
thread” is in no sense a primary membrane, not corresponding histologically to
a cellular membrane. On the contrary, the “peritoneal membrane comprises
the primary element of the trachea; it is nowhere absent, but envelops the
smallest branches, as well as the largest trunks, only varying in thickness, which
in the embryo and the young larva of Musca stands in relation to the thickness
of the lumen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The trachea, then, consists primarily of an epithelial layer, the
“peritoneal membrane,” or the invaginated epiblast; from this layer
an intima is secreted, just as the skin or cuticle is secreted by the
hypodermis. We may call the peritoneal membrane the <i>ectotrachea</i>,
the intima or inner layer derived from the ectotrachea the <i>endotrachea</i>.
The so-called “spiral threads” are a thickening of the
endotracheal membrane, sometimes arranged in a spiral manner. For
these chitinous bands we have proposed the name <i>tænidia</i> (Greek, little
bands).</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the origin of the spiral thread our observations<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> have been
made on the caterpillar of a species of Datana, which was placed in
alcohol, just before pupation, when the larva was in a semipupal
condition, and the larval skin could be readily stripped off. At this
time the ectotrachea of the larva had undergone histolysis, nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>remaining but the moulted endotrachea, represented by the tænidia,
which lay loosely within the cavity of the trachea. The ectotrachea
or peritoneal membrane of the pupa is meanwhile in process of
formation; the nuclear origin of the tænidia is now very apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 412 represents a longitudinal section through a secondary
tracheal branch, showing
the origin of the
chitinous bands, or tænidia.
At <i>t′</i> are pieces
of six tænidia which
have been moulted;
<i>ectr</i> indicates the nuclei
forming the outer
cellular layer, the ectotrachea
or peritoneal
membrane. These nuclei
send long slender
prolongations around
the inside of the peritoneal
membrane; these prolongations, as may be seen by the figure,
become the tænidia. The tænidia, being closely approximate, grow
together more or less, and a thin endotracheal membrane is thus
produced, of which the tænidia are the thickened band-like portions.
The endotracheal membrane is thus derived from the ectotrachea,
or primitive tracheal membrane,
and the so-called “spiral
thread” is formed by thickenings
of the nuclei composing
the secondary layer of nuclei,
and which become filled with
the chitin secreted by these
elongated nuclei. The middle
portion of the tænidia, immediately
after the moult, is
clear and transparent, with
obscure minute granules, while
the nuclear base of the cell is
filled as usual with abundant granules, and contains a distinct
nucleolus.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The origin of the tænidia is also well shown by Fig. 413, which
is likewise a longitudinal section of a trachea at the point of origin
of a branch. The peritracheal membrane or ectotrachea (<i>ectr</i>) is
composed of large granulated nuclei; and within are the more transparent
endotracheal cells; at <i>t′</i> are fragments of the moulted tænidia.
The new tænidia are in process of development at <i>t</i>; at base they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>are seen to be granulated nuclei, with often a distinct nucleolus, each
sending a long, slender, transparent, pointed process along the inside
of the trachea. These unite to form the chitinous bands or spiral
threads.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Internal hair-like bodies.</b>—In the large tracheæ of Lampyris very
fine chitinous bristles project free into the cavity of the tube (Gerstaecher),
while according to Leydig there are similar chitinous points
in the tracheæ of the Carabid beetle Procrustes. Dugardin had
previously (1849) called attention to such hairs, giving a list of the
insects in which he observed them. Emery figures a section of the
tracheæ of Luciola, “in wendig behaart.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> Stokes has described
those of <i>Zaitha fluminea</i> (Fig. 414) as “internal chitinous, hair-like
bodies arising from the fold of the tænidia and projecting into the
lumen of the tubes.” They are hollow, their minute cavity distinctly
communicating with that of the tænidium, from which they arise by
an enlarged base. They end in an exceedingly fine point which is
occasionally bifid or trifid. In Fig. 414, <span class='small'>4</span>, several are shown attached
to the wrinkles of the tracheæ near a spiracle, and at <span class='small'>5</span> is represented
a transverse section of a trachea with three hairs projecting
into its cavity.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Stokes has also described “certain minute, elliptical bodies in the tænidia,
each with an internal, presumably glandular, appendage, to all appearance
forming part of the tænidium from which it springs.” These are shown in
Fig. 414, at <span class='small'>1</span>, <span class='small'>3</span>, and, more in detail, at <span class='small'>6</span>; those at <span class='small'>7</span>, whose thickness is about
<span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>8000</span></span> of an inch, appear as collections of exceedingly minute, rounded apertures
in a cushion-like mass. Although not commonly occurring on the tracheal
membrane between the tænidia, they may be found there, as at <span class='small'>4</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>f.</i> The mechanism of respiration and the respiratory movements of insects</h4>

<p class='c016'>By holding a locust in the hand one may observe the ordinary
mode of breathing in insects. During this act the portion of the
side of the body between the stigmata and the pleurum contracts and
expands; the contraction of this region causes the spiracles to open.
The general movement is caused by the sternal moving much more
decidedly than the tergal portion of the abdomen. When the pleural
portion of the abdomen is forced out, the soft pleural membranous
region under the fore and hind wings contracts, as does the tympanum,
or ear, and the membranous portions at the base of the hind
legs. When the tergum or dorsal portion of the abdomen falls, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>the pleurum contracts, the spiracles open; their opening is nearly
but not always exactly coördinated with the contractions of the
pleurum, but as a rule they are. There were 65 contractions in a
minute in a locust which had been held between the fingers about
ten minutes. It was noticed that when the abdomen expanded, the
air-sacs in the first abdominal ring contracted.</p>

<p class='c007'>For expanding the abdomen no special muscles are required, since
it expands by the elasticity of the parts. For contracting its walls
there are two sets of muscles, viz., special vertical expiratory muscles
serving to compress or flatten the abdomen (Figs. 415–418), and
other muscles which draw together or telescope the segments.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was formerly supposed that when the abdomen contracted the
air was expelled from the body and the tracheæ emptied; that, when
the abdomen again expanded by its own elasticity, the air-tubes were
refilled, and that no other mechanism was needed. But Landois
insisted that this was not enough; as Miall and Denny state:
“Air must be forced into the furthest recesses of the tracheal system,
where the exchange of oxygen and carbonic acid is effected more
readily than in tubes lined by a dense intima. But in these fine and
intricate passages the resistance to the passage of air is considerable,
and the renewal of the air could, to all appearance, hardly be effected
at all if the inlets remained open. Landois accordingly searched for
some means of closing the outlets, and found an elastic ring or spiral,
which surrounds the tracheal tube within the spiracle.” By means
of the occlusor muscle this ring compresses the tube, “like a spring
clip upon a flexible gas-pipe.” “When the muscle contracts, the
passage is closed, and the abdominal muscles can then, it is supposed,
bring any needful pressure to bear upon the tracheal tubes, much in
the same way as with ourselves, when we close the mouth and
nostrils, and then, by forcible contraction of the diaphragm and
abdominal walls, distend the cheeks or pharynx.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus an important point in the respiration of tracheate animals,
whether insects, myriopods, or arachnids, is, as Landois claimed, the
closure of the spiracles, in order that pressure may be brought upon
the air in the tubes, so that it may pass onward into the finest terminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injection of air by muscular pressure into a system of very
fine tubes may, as Miall and Denny remark, appear extremely difficult
or even impossible. Graham (Researches, p. 44) applies the law
of diffusion of gases to explain the respiration of insects, but until
physical experiments have been made, we may, with Miall and Denny,
“be satisfied that an appreciable quantity of air may be made by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>muscular pressure to flow along even the finer air-passages of an
insect.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the respiratory movements of insects, Plateau is the principal
authority, and the following account of the process is taken from his
elaborate memoir, and from the statements afterwards contributed
by him to Miall and Denny’s “The Cockroach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although many observers have superficially described the respiratory
movements of various insects, Rathke was the first one to
state precise views as to the mechanism of respiration. His posthumous
work, treating of the respiratory movements of the movable
chitinous plates of the abdomen, and of the respiratory muscles
characteristic of all the principal groups, filled an important blank
in our knowledge. But, notwithstanding the skill displayed in this
research, many questions still remain unanswered which require
more exact methods than mere observations with the naked eye or
the simple lens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plateau, who was followed a year later by Langendorff, conceived
the idea of studying, by such graphic methods as are now familiar,
the respiratory movements of perfect insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has made use of two modes of investigation. The first, or graphic
method, in the strict sense of the term, consisted in recording, upon a revolving
cylinder of smoked paper, the respiratory movements, transmitted by means of
very light levers of Bristol board attached to any part of the insect’s exoskeleton.
Unfortunately, this plan is only applicable to insects of more than average
size. A second method, that of projection, consisted in introducing the insect,
carried upon a small support, into a large magic lantern fitted with a good petroleum
lamp. When the amplification does not exceed 12 diameters, a sharp
profile may be obtained, upon which the actual displacements may be measured,
true to the fraction of a millimetre. Placing a sheet of white paper upon the
lantern screen, the outlines of the profile are carefully traced in pencil so as to
give two superposed figures, representing the phases of inspiration and expiration
respectively. By altering the position of the insect so as to obtain profiles of
transverse sections, or of the different parts of the body, and, further, by gluing
very small paper slips to parts whose movements are hard to observe, the
successive positions of the slips being then drawn, complete information is at
last obtained of every detail of the respiratory movements; nothing is lost.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This method, similar to that employed by the English physiologist, Hutchinson,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
is valuable, because it enables us, with a little practice, to investigate
readily the respiratory movements of very small arthropods, such as flies or
lady-birds. It has this advantage over all others, that it leaves no room for
errors of interpretation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not satisfied with mere observation by such means as these, of the respiratory
movements of insects, the writer has also studied the muscles concerned,
and, in common with other physiologists (Faivre, Barlow, Luchsinger, Dönhoff,
and Langendorff), has examined the action of the various nervous centres upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>the respiratory organs. The result at which he has arrived may be summarized
as follows:—</p>

<div  class='figleft id031'>
<img src='images/i_472a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 415.</span>—Muscles of right half of the abdomen of <i>Forficula auricularia</i>: <i>A</i>, <i>a</i>, longitudinal tergal and sternal muscles; <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, oblique muscles; <i>a</i> (in upper figure) vertical expirator muscles.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“1. There is no close relation between the character of the respiratory movements
of an insect and its systematic position. Respiratory movements are
similar only when the arrangement of the abdominal segments, and especially
when the disposition of the attached muscles, are almost identical. Thus, for
example, the respiratory
movements of the cockroach
are different from
those of other Orthoptera,
resembling those of
the heteropterous Hemiptera.
Those of the Trichoptera
are like those
of the aculeate Hymenoptera,
while the Locustidæ
ally themselves in
respect to these movements
with the Neuroptera
and Lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>“2. The respiratory movements of insects, when at rest, are localized in the
abdomen. As graphically stated by Graber, in insects the chest is placed at
the hinder end of the body. If thoracic respiratory movements exist, they do
not depend on the action of special muscles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“3. In most cases the thoracic segments do not share in the respiratory movements
of an insect at rest. The respiratory displacements of the posterior segments
of the thorax are, however, less rare than Rathke believed. Plateau has
observed them in certain Coleoptera (Staphylinus, Chlorophanus, Corymbites),
and they are more feebly manifested in Hydrophilus, Carabus, and Tenebrio.
Among the singular exceptions to this rule is the cockroach (<i>Periplaneta
orientalis</i>), in which the terga of the meso- and metathoracic segments perform
movements exactly opposite in direction to those of the abdomen (Fig. 419).</p>

<div  class='figright id059'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“4. Leaving out of account all details and all exceptions, the respiratory
movements of insects may be said to consist of the alternate contraction
and recovery of the figure of the abdomen
in two dimensions, viz. vertical
and transverse. During expiration both
diameters are reduced, while during
inspiration they revert to their previous
amounts. The transverse expiratory
contraction is often slight, and may be
imperceptible. On the other hand, the
vertical expiratory contraction is never
absent, and usually marked. In the
cockroach (<i>P. orientalis</i>) it amounts to
one-eighth of the depth of the abdomen (between segments 2 and 3); in
<i>Eristalis tenax</i> to one-ninth (at the 2d segment).</p>

<p class='c013'>“5. Three principal types of respiratory mechanism occur in insects, and
these admit of further subdivision:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<i>a.</i> Sterna usually short and very convex, yielding but little. Terga mobile,
rising and sinking appreciably. To this class belong all Coleoptera, heteropterous
Hemiptera, and Blattina (Fig. 420).</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the cockroach (Periplaneta), the sterna are slightly raised during expiration
(Fig. 421).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>“<i>b.</i> Terga well developed, overlapping the sterna on the sides of the body, and
usually concealing the pleural membrane, which forms a sunken fold. The terga
and sterna approach and recede alternately, the sterna being almost always the
more mobile. To this type belong Odonata, Diptera, aculeate Hymenoptera, and
acrydian Orthoptera (Fig. 422).</p>

<div  class='figright id034'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<i>c.</i> The pleural membrane,
connecting the terga with the
sterna, is well developed and exposed
on the sides of the body.
The terga and sterna approach
and recede alternately, while the
pleural zone simultaneously becomes
depressed, or returns to its
original figure. To this type,
Plateau assigns the Locustidæ,
Lepidoptera, and the true Neuroptera
(excluding Trichoptera)
(Fig. 423).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“6. Contrary to the opinion
once general, changes in length
of the abdomen, involving protrusion
of the segments and subsequent
retraction, are rare in
the normal respiration of insects.
Such longitudinal movements extend
throughout one entire group
only, viz. the aculeate Hymenoptera.
Isolated examples occur,
however, in other zoölogical
groups.</p>

<p class='c013'>“7. Among insects, such as large beetles, Locustidæ, dragon-flies, etc., sufficiently
powerful to give good graphic tracings, it can be shown that the inspiratory
movement is slower than the expiratory, and that the latter is often sudden.</p>

<div  class='figleft id018'>

The arrows show the direction of the expiratory movement: <i>Ms. th</i>, mesothorax; <i>Mt. th</i>, metathorax. Reduced from a magic-lantern projection.—After Plateau.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“8. In most insects, contrary to what obtains in mammals, only the expiratory
movement is active; inspiration is passive, and effected by the elasticity of
the body-wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“9. Most insects possess
expiratory muscles only.
Certain Diptera (<i>Calliphora
vomitoria</i> and <i>Eristalis
tenax</i>) afford the simplest
arrangement of the expiratory
muscles. In these
types, they form a muscular
sheet of vertical fibres, connecting
the terga with the
sterna, and underlying the
soft, elastic membrane which
unites the hard parts of the somites. One of the most frequent complications
arises by the differentiations of this sheet of vertical fibres into distinct muscles,
repeated in every segment, and becoming more and more separated as the sterna
increase in length. Special inspiratory muscles occur in Hymenoptera, Acridiidæ,
and Trichoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>“10. The abdominal, respiratory movements of insects are wholly reflex. Like
other physiologists who have examined this side of the question, Plateau finds
that the respiratory movements persist in a decapitated insect, as also after
destruction of the cerebral ganglia or œsophageal connectives; further, that in
insects whose nervous system is not highly concentrated (<i>e.g.</i> Acridiidæ and
dragon-flies), the respiratory movements persist in the completely detached
abdomen; while all external influences which promote an increased respiratory
activity in the uninjured animal, have precisely the same action upon insects in
which the anterior, nervous centres have been removed, upon the detached
abdomen, and even upon isolated sections of the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The view formerly advocated by Faivre, that the metathoracic ganglia play
the part of special, respiratory centres, must be entirely abandoned. All carefully
performed experiments on the nervous system of Arthropoda have shown
that each ganglion of the ventral chain is a motor centre, and, in insects, a
respiratory centre, for the somite to which it belongs. This is what Barlow calls
the ‘self-sufficiency’ of the ganglia.” (Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Plateau has made similar observations upon the respiration of spiders and
scorpions; but, to his great surprise, he was unable, either by direct observation,
or by the graphic method, or by projection, to discover the slightest respiratory
movement of the exterior of the body. This can only be explained by supposing
that inspiration and expiration in pulmonate Arachnida are “intrapulmonary,”
and affect only the proper, respiratory organs. The fact is less surprising
because of the wide zoölogical separation between Arachnida and insects.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>g.</i> The air-sacs</h4>

<p class='c016'>In flying insects the tracheæ are in certain parts of the body
enlarged into sacs of various sizes. These air-sacs were first
observed by Swammerdam in a beetle (Geotrupes) and afterwards
by Sir John Hunter in the bee, Sprengel subsequently discovering
them in other insects. Those of the cockroach were described and
illustrated in a very elaborate and detailed way by Straus-Dürckheim
(Figs. 424 and 425). These vesicles are without tænidia. In the
locust (<i>M. femur-rubrum</i>) there is a pair of very large vesicles in the
prothorax (Fig. 396). The five pairs of large abdominal air-sacs
arise, independently of the main tracheæ, directly from branches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>originating from the spiracles. All these large sacs are superficial,
lying directly beneath the hypodermis, while the smaller ones are
buried among the muscles. We have detected 53 of these vesicles
in the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the honey-bee
(Fig. 426) and
humble bee (Fig.
427) as well as the
flies there are two
enormous air-sacs
at the base of the
abdomen. In larval
and wingless
insects these sacs
are entirely absent.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The use of the
air-sacs.</b>—It was
supposed by Hunter
as well as by
Newport, and the
view has been generally
held, that
the use of these
sacs is to lighten
the weight, <i>i.e.</i> lessen
the specific
gravity of the body
during flight. It
has, however, been
suggested to us by
A. A. Packard that
this view from the
standpoint of
physics is incorrect.
It is evident
that the wings
have to support
just as much
weight when the insect is flying, whether the tracheæ and vesicles
are filled with air or not, the body of the insect during flight not
being lightened by the air in the sacs. The use of these numerous
sacs, some of them very spacious, is to afford a greater supply of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>air or oxygen than that contained in the air-tubes alone, and thus to
afford a greater breathing capacity. The sacs are largest in dragon-flies,
moths, flies, and bees, which are
swift of flight. When we compare
the active movements of these insects
on the wing with those of a caterpillar
or maggot, it will be seen that the far
greater muscular exertions of the
volant insect create a demand for a
sudden and abundant supply of air
to correspond to the increased rapidity
of respiration; and the enlargements
of the air-tubes, rapidly filled
with air at each inspiration, render it
possible to supply the demand.</p>

from that of those fishes which, having a swimming-bladder,
can in the water change the
specific gravity of their bodies. The case of
insects is almost exactly paralleled by that
of birds, where, as stated
by Wiedersheim, the air-sacs
appear to form integral
parts of the respiratory apparatus:
“a greater
amount of air can by their
means pass in and out during
inspiration and expiration,
especially through the
larger bronchi, and consequently
there is less
necessity for the expansion
of the lung parenchyma.”
In other words, the supply
of air in these sacs, as in
insects, increases the
breathing capacity of the
bird during flight. Wiedersheim’s
retention of the
old idea that the specific
gravity of the body is lessened
(p. 262) seems, however,
to be incorrect, as
the weight of the bird’s
body is not diminished by
the air contained in the
sacs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>There are two chief morphological tracheal systems: 1. The open
or normal and primitive (<i>holopneustic</i>) type, and 2. The closed, or
secondary and adaptive, <i>i.e.</i> <i>apneustic</i>, type. The open system is
characterized by the presence of the stigmata. Through them the
air directly enters into the tracheal tubes, whose delicate walls allow
the exchange of gases in the
blood. This type occurs in all
sexually mature individuals,
and also in the greater number
of larvæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The closed or apneustic
tracheal system is distinguished
either by the want of stigmata,
or, if present, they are not open,
and do not function, so that the
tracheæ cannot communicate
with the air. In such cases the
direct oxygenation of the blood
is effected through the delicate
integument, especially over the
surface of the body in general,
or in certain specialized places
where the gill-like expansions
of the skin are rich in tracheæ;
such outgrowths, generally
tubular or leaf-like, are called
by Palmén <i>tracheal gills</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This closed form of the
tracheal system only occurs in
the larval stage of aquatic or
parasitic insects, as in the
Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ), Perlidæ, Odonata, and Trichoptera,
besides single genera of other orders, <i>i.e.</i> among Coleoptera, Gyrinus,
Pelobius, Cnemidotus, and the young larva of Elmis; in the aquatic
caterpillar of Paraponyx; in certain Diptera (Corethra, Chironomus,
etc.), and some of the parasitic Hymenoptera (Microgaster).</p>

<p class='c007'>Palmén has discovered that in the nymphs of Ephemeridæ, Perlidæ,
Odonata, and the larvæ of most Trichoptera the tracheal branch
(stigmatal branch) sent from the longitudinal trachea to where the
thoracic stigmata would be situated if present, or where their vestiges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>only exist, are aborted, becoming simple solid cords not filled with
air (Fig. 436, <i>vf</i>, and 447, <i>f</i>, funiculus or stigmatic cord). In the
imago, however, they resume their function, connecting with the open
functional stigmata. In Corethra, in its earliest stages, the entire
tracheal system is, like the stigmatic branch, a system of solid cords
and empty of air. (Palmén.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Embryology shows that these stigmatal branches are well developed, and are
formed at the same time as the stigmata. It was also shown by Dewitz, in a
posthumous paper (1890), that in the young larval stage of the Odonata and
Ephemeridæ the tracheal system is at first an open one, and in some of the
families (Libellulidæ, Agrionidæ, and Ephemeridæ) thoracic stigmata are seen
at a very early stage. From numerous experiments Dewitz concludes that in
the young stages of Odonata and Ephemeridæ there is an open tracheal system;
certainly in very young nymphs the thoracic spiracles allow the air to pass out.
Fully grown nymphs of Æschnidæ, Libellulidæ, and Agrionidæ are capable not
only of forcing the air out, but also, like the perfect insect, of inhaling it.
Moreover, he proved that the gills of Ephemeridæ and Agrionidæ are not indispensable
for the maintenance of life, as the insects can live without them,
breathing either through the skin or by the rectum, or in both ways. It would
seem that while in freshly hatched or very young larvæ of aquatic insects of
different orders the skin is so delicate as to allow of dermal respiration, in after
life, when the skin becomes thicker and denser, these expansions (gills), provided
with a very thin and delicate skin, of a necessity grow out from the walls
of the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>It thus appears that the closure and total or partial abolition of the stigmata
are in adaptation to aquatic life, and that such insects have descended from
terrestrial air-breathing winged forms. This is an important argument against
the view that the wings are modified tracheal gills.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this connection may be noticed the closure of the 2d and 3d thoracic stigmata
in holopneustic insects. We have found on laying open the body of a
Sphinx larva that a large number of tracheal branches are seen to arise from the
prothoracic and from the first pair of abdominal stigmata. Now between these
points there are no spiracles or any external signs of them, there being in
Lepidoptera no mesothoracic or metathoracic spiracles. Yet the main lateral
trachea between the prothoracic and first abdominal segments deviates from its
course and bends down to send off a small shrivelled stigmatal branch or cord
to a place where, did a spiracle exist, we should look for it. In the larva of
<i>Platysamia cecropia</i>, a similar vestigial stigmata branch is present.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the larva of Corydalus, also, a trachea as large as the main longitudinal
one takes its origin and passes directly under the main trachea. Now both
tracheæ send a stigmatal branch opposite to where the mesothoracic stigma
should be, if present, <i>i.e.</i> on the hind edge of the segment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Verson, moreover, has found in the freshly hatched silkworm vestiges of
meso- and metathoracic stigmata, each consisting of a circle of high hypodermal
cells radially arranged around a common centre. The stigmatal branch is long,
but shrivelled; its peritoneum is widened out into several berry-like saccules
filled with cell-elements. In profile these rudimentary stigmata appear as a
series of high hypodermal cells, which form the basis of a short blind tube.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After the second moult there begins a peculiar transformation of the rudimentary
stigmata. The stigmatal branch connected with them sends off at
various points thick tufts of capillary tracheæ which press against the base of
the blind tube. Gradually lengthening, they form a fold which continues to
increase in length. The numerous tufts of tracheal capillaries extend beyond
the inner surface of the two layers of which the developing wing consists, the
berry-like saccules are drawn into the wing and converted into more or less
thick tubes, which finally form the “veins.” It is clear, therefore, says Verson,
as Landois claimed, that the wings of Lepidoptera must be regarded as in
the fullest sense organs of respiration. (Zool. Anz., 1890, p. 116.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of pairs of stigmata varies, especially in maggots or
larval Diptera, in adaptation to their varied modes of life. The
larvæ of most flies (Muscidæ) have a pair of peculiarly shaped processes
on the prothoracic segment bearing spiracular openings, and
two anal spiracles, while in <i>Ctenophora atrata</i> L. only the anal pair
are present. In the rat-tailed maggots (Eristalis) the long caudal
process ends in two stigmata forming a respiratory tube, which can
be thrust out of the water for the reception of air. In the larval
mosquito (Fig. 433) and its ally, Mochlonyx, a short thick dorsal tube
arises from the penultimate segment of the body, in which the two
main tracheæ end, opening outward by a single spiracular aperture.
Other dipterous larvæ (Simulium, Tanypus, and Ceratopogon) possess
no spiracles, the tracheal system being a closed one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larvæ of most water beetles (Dyticidæ, Hydrophilidæ)
possess but two spiracles, which, as in maggots, are situated at
the end of the body. The aquatic larva of Amphizoa, according to
Hubbard, breathes much as in the Dyticidæ, by means of two large
valvular spiracles placed close together at the end of the body;
“closed or rudimentary stigmata also occur on the mesothorax and
on abdominal segments one to seven inclusive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hubbard adds: “The larva of Pelobius is wholly aquatic and breathes by
branchiæ, but the obsolete stigmata are indicated precisely as in Amphizoa,
with the exception of the last pair, which in Amphizoa are open spiracles, but
in Pelobius are suppressed; the terminal eight segments being prolonged in a
swimming stylet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From a review of the distribution of spiracles, and their atrophy,
partial or total, it will be seen that there are intermediate stages
between the open (holopneustic) and closed (apneustic) systems.
These, following Schiner, Brauer, and Palmén, may be defined thus:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. <i>Metapneustic type.</i>—The larvæ possess only a single pair of open stigmata
situated at the end of the body. (The dipterous Eristalis, Tipula, Culex,
Ptychoptera, Bittacomorpha (Plate I.) with certain Tachinidæ, and in Coleoptera,

<h4 class='c011'><i>i.</i> The rectal tracheal gills, and rectal respiration of larval Odonata and other insects</h4>

</div>
<p class='c016'>The remarkable mode of respiration by tracheal gills situated
within the intestine of the nymphs of dragon-flies was first described
by Swammerdam and afterwards by Réaumur. The most complete
and best illustrated modern account is that of Oustalet. In these
insects the large rectum is lined with six double longitudinal ridges,
in Æschna bearing numerous delicate tubes or papillæ, each of
which contains very numerous (by estimate 24,000) tracheal branches
(Fig. 431); while in Libellula the gills are lamellate (Fig. 432). The
tracheæ arise both from the main dorsal and visceral longitudinal
trunks, which give rise to secondary branches passing into the walls
of the rectum and sending into the branchial papillæ fine twigs,
which, extending to the distal end of the papilla or lamella, recurve
and anastomose with the efferent twigs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The anal opening is externally protected by the suranal and lateral
triangular chitinous plates, three to five in all. When open, the water
passes into the rectum and bathes the rectal gills, where it may be
forcibly expelled as if shot out from a syringe, thus propelling the
insect forward. In Libellula the anus affords direct access to the
intestinal cavity, but in Æschna Oustalet describes “a sort of vestibule
separated from the rectum by a circular valvule.” He also
states that the inspiration and the repulsion of water is produced at
irregular intervals, and rather by the movements of the dorsal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>sternal arches of the
abdomen than by the
contractions of the rectum,
since the walls of
this organ are less muscular
than is supposed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The nymph of Calopteryx
(and probably of all
the group Calopteryginæ)
possesses rectal gills besides
external caudal tracheal
gills. There are
three double rectal longitudinal
folds or ridges,
interpenetrated by tracheal
twigs. (Dufour, denied by
Poletaiew, but confirmed
by Hagen.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Dewitz claims that the
caudal gills of the Agrionidæ
are not their sole
means of respiration, since
he cut off the caudal tracheal
gills of an Agrionid
nymph, which continued
to live for a week. Hence
he thinks that there may be
a rectal respiration, since
under the microscope he
saw a stream of water pass
in and out of the end of the
intestine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dewitz’ experiments
prove that in young
Ephemerids there may be
besides branchial, both rectal
and skin respiration.
He saw under the microscope
the anus for a while
opened and then closed,
causing the rectum to
move; powdered carmine
mixed with water was
drawn into and then expelled
from the rectum.
There was, however, no
enlargement and contraction
of the abdomen as in
the rectal respiration of
Æschna. (Zool. Anz. 1890,
p. 500.)</p>

it at once, in order to

to have a rectal respiration.
At the anterior

pass through the walls and, subdividing, end in numberless very
fine twigs in the papilla-like folds situated within the rectum. The
supply of tracheal twigs is greatest where the papillæ are largest.

<p class='c016'>In many aquatic insects respiration is carried on by tracheal gills.
These are delicate, hollow, leaf-like or tubular outgrowths of the
integument usually attached to the sides or end of the hind-body,
and containing a trachea which usually sends off numerous minute
branches, so that the exchange of gases readily takes place in them.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Palmén has shown that these tracheal gills, as he calls them, are
not developed on the same segments as the stigmata, and that the
two structures have no genetic
connection with each
other. It is evident that
these gills are secondary,
adaptive organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases (see p. 475) the tracheæ are wanting, but as such
gills are filled with blood, the air contained in the water must pass
in through their delicate walls.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ) the tracheal gills are either foliaceous
or filamentous; when foliaceous they form simple or double
leaves, with or without branches, or with a fringe of tubules, or
under the leaf-like cover-bearing tufts of filaments. They are situated
on the (usually) basal seven abdominal segments, at their
hinder edge (Figs. 435, 436). In Oligoneuria and Jolia a pair occurs
on the under side of the head, attached to the maxillæ, while in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>Jolia there is a pair on the under side of the first thoracic segment at
the insertion of each of the legs. In certain genera (Heptagenia,
Oligoneuria, and Jolia), they are in the form of a flat cover, under
which lies a tuft of respiratory tubes, or
(Ephemerella) a small bifid cluster of very
delicate leaves (Fig. 437, <i>A</i>). In Cœnis and Tricorythus
the tracheal gills of the second pair are modified to form
plates covering all the succeeding pairs, those of the first pair being
nearly atrophied and well-nigh functionless.

<p class='c007'>Finally, in the highly modified forms
Bætisca and Prosopistoma the tracheal gills
are entirely concealed and protected by
mesothoracic projections so as to form a
true respiratory chamber, to which the
water has access either by an opening behind,
as in Bætisca, or by three openings,
two ventral and one dorsal (Fig. 441), as in
Prosopistoma.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slender cylindrical tracheal gills of
Heptagenia in the third or fourth nymphal
stage are 2–jointed, and the first abdominal
pair in Cænis are said by Palmén to be
finger-shaped and 2–jointed. In <i>Polymitarcys

<p class='c007'>In the nymphs of Perlidæ the tracheal gills are usually present,

side of the thorax, or on the sides of
the abdomen, or are restricted to a
tuft on each side of the anus at the
base of the caudal stylets (Pteronarcys
and Perla). Unlike the Ephemeridæ
the gills persist in certain genera
throughout life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larvæ of the aquatic Neuroptera,
Sisyra, Sialis, and Corydalus
possess lateral
pointed bristle-like
tracheal
gills, which in
Sisyra are 2–jointed;
those of
Sialis are, in the
living larva,
curved upwards
and backwards
(Fig. 444). Corydalus
is also provided with a ventral tuft of delicate filamentous
gills, which, however, according to Riley, do not appear until after
the first moult.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the nymphs of Agrionidæ (which have rectal gills) respire
chiefly by the large caudal foliaceous gills (Fig. 445), there are,
according to Hagen, two genera of the Calopteryginæ (Euphæa, Fig.
445, and Anisopleura) whose nymphs possess seven pairs of external
lateral tracheal gills, in shape like those of Sialis, besides three caudal
and three rectal tracheal gills.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

of which contains a smaller sac lined with epithelium,—as in Æschna they occur
in the 5th and 6th, and in Gomphus in the 4th, 5th, and 6th segments. This
serial arrangement appears to confirm Hagen’s suggestion that they are survivals
of abdominal gills, which in
Euphæa are completely evaginated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Trichoptera, all
of which, except Enoicyla,
are apneustic, and
most of which have tracheal
gills, the latter are
filamentous, and arise
either from the dorsal

they grow out from the
sides; while in certain
genera (Neuronia, Phryganea,

<p class='c007'>The only lepidopterous larva known to be provided with tracheal
gills is that of the pyralid genus
Paraponyx. Its thread-like
gills, arranged in tufts of three
or four, arise from a common tubercle situated on the sides of nearly
all the segments. Wood-Mason describes the East Indian <i>P. oryzalis</i>
as “covered with a perfect forest of
soft and delicate white filaments,”
arranged in tufts disposed in four
longitudinal rows. “The stigmata
of the 2d, 3d, and 4th abdominal
somites only are clearly discernible.”
The caterpillar crawls “free and uncovered”
over the submerged leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>of the rice plant “in the very midst of the water.” In a Brazilian
species of Paraponyx described as <i>Cataclysta pyropalis</i>, by W. Müller,
the tufts are reduced to simple unbranched filaments, and the case
is more complex than in the European species (Fig. 449).</p>

<p class='c007'>Of coleopterous larvæ breathing by tracheal gills there are but few.
The larva of Gyrinus (Fig. 454) respires by 10 pairs of slender, hairy
abdominal gills similar to
those of Corydalus, and the
stigmata are entirely wanting.
Somewhat similar are
the tracheal gills of <i>Hydrocharis
caraboides</i>. Hydrobius
has shorter setose gills,
our American species having
seven pairs of short setose
gills. It has two spiracles
at the end of the body,
through which the air is
taken by thrusting the body
out of the water. The larvæ
of two other aquatic coleopterous
genera, Pelobius
and Cnemidotus, also have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>gills; those of the former situated at the base of the coxæ, and
brush-like, but containing no tracheæ, though filled with blood,
while those of Cnemidotus are very long, bristle-like, jointed, and
arising from the dorsal side of the thoracic and abdominal segments.
The stigmata are wanting. (Schiödte.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The larva of the dipterous genus Tanypus respires by two caudal
papilliform processes, in each of which a trachea ramifies.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Certain larvæ with both stigmata and tracheal gills are enabled
either to live in or out of water or on the surface, as in the case of
certain beetles (Cyphonidæ, Elmidæ, Hydrophilidæ, Fig. 452), or the
larval mosquito and Psychodes (Fig. 455); also the nymphs of
dragon-flies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larvæ of the Cyphonidæ
(Helodes, Cyphon,
Hydrocyphon) possess but
a single pair of stigmata,
situated in the penultimate
abdominal segment, while at
the end of the abdomen are
delicate tracheal gills. The
two main tracheal trunks are
much swollen. When on the
surface of the water the larva
breathes through the stigmata
situated near the end
of the abdomen; when floating
in the water, the larva,
like that of Gyrinus, carries
along at the end of its body
a bubble of air. The gills
are only of use, as Rolph
thinks, when the insect is compelled to remain a long time under water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larva of our native <i>Prionocyphon discoideus</i> (Say) is described
by Walsh as “vibrating vigorously up and down a pencil of hairs
proceeding from a horizontal slit in the tail”; this pencil is composed
“of three pairs of filaments, each beautifully bipectinate. I
presume it is used to extract air from the water.” When the larva
is at the surface the pencil of hairs touches the surface of the water,
and occasionally a bubble of air is discharged from the tail. “The
general habit is to crawl on decayed wood beneath the surface,
occasionally swimming to the surface, probably for a fresh supply of
air.” (Proc. Ent. Soc. Phil., i, p. 117.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The larvæ of the small water beetles of the family Elmidæ (Elmis,
Potamophilus, Macronychus, and Psephenus) have similar habits.
That of Elmis has ten dorsally situated pairs of spiracles, and on the
end of the body bushy gills which are protruded at pleasure. The
young larva is without spiracles, its tracheal system being closed.
Macronychus and Potamophilus have similar habits. In the larva of
the latter genus, which has nine pairs of spiracles, there are at the
end of the body on each side three tufts of
thread-like gills which are connected with
the two main horizontal tracheæ, while the
branches of the abdominal tracheæ are
dilated into numerous (64) bladder-like
sacs. The larva usually breathes through
the caudal gills. When the water is low
or dried up, the air is inhaled directly
through the spiracles. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The larva of <i>Psephenus lecontei</i>, by its
broad hemispherical body, is adapted to adhere to the
smooth surface of rounded stones, in which situation we
have found it. Although it is said by Rolph to have two pairs of
spiracles, one pair on the mesothoracic and the other on the 1st
abdominal segment, it probably rarely rises to the surface to breathe
the air direct.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It possesses five pairs of gills on the under side of the 2d to the
6th abdominal segments. Each gill has finger-shaped processes on
its hinder edge, which are “from their constant motion evidently
connected with respiration.” Tracheæ may be seen, according to
H. J. Clark, entering the gills, and “the circulation of water among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>the branchiæ is kept up by the flapping of the tail-pieces.” The
larva of <i>Helichus fastigiatus</i> is said by Leconte to be “very nearly
allied, while the remotely allied <i>Stenelmis crenatus</i> has no external
branchiæ.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>The larva of the mosquito also has two modes of respiration, breathing either
at the surface of the water through the two spiracles situated on the projection
(siphon) at the hinder end of the body which is thrust out into the air; or when
at the bottom respiring by tracheal gills. The pupa also has a double mode of
respiration, either taking in air at the surface by the two thoracic horns with
stigmatic openings, or when submerged using its tracheal gills.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besides its long caudal tracheal air-tubes, the larval Eristalis is said by Chun
to thrust out from the anus a number (20) of short tracheal filaments which float
about in the water and serve to absorb the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>An aquatic Brazilian larva of the family Psychodidæ has been
found by Fritz Müller to take down under the water a large bubble
of air (Fig. 455, <i>C</i>), the main tracheal trunk ending each in an opening
at the end of the body (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>); besides
this, while at the bottom it breathes by
three digitiform tracheal gills; another
species having two pairs (<i>C</i>, <i>a</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The remarkable larvæ of the Blepharoceridæ (represented in the
United States by <i>Blepharocera capitata</i>), which live permanently in
swift streams, attached by median suckers to stones, are apneustic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>and breathe solely by leaf-like tracheal gills (Fig. 456, <i>br</i>) attached to
the under side of the second to sixth abdominal segments. Those of
the European Liponeura are said by Wierzejski to be branched, tree-like.
Also immediately in front of the anus and behind the last
sucker are four membranous sacs provided with tracheæ, but which
are not capable of being withdrawn. These are said by Müller to be
the same as what Dewitz states to serve as gills, and by Wierzejski
they are homologized with the four anal gills of Chironomus.</p>

<p class='c013'>The double mode of respiration in the larva of the horse bot-fly has been
described by Scheiber. On the hinder end of the body are the stigmatic plates,
which contain two lateral gill-plates and the middle stigmatal leaf. Besides this
there is a pair of slightly developed prothoracic spiracles. The embryo and also
freshly hatched larva of <i>Gastrophilus equi</i> do not possess these gill-plates, but on
the end of the body are, according to Joli, two long thread-like gills. The
freshly hatched larva of the allied <i>Cephenomyia rufibarbis</i> bears two caudal
projections. (Kolbe.) As in shrimps and other Crustacea the gills are kept in
constant motion, the water being driven over them by the rapid movements of
the telson, so in the larval may-flies, and in the case-worm (Macronema), the
gills move more or less rapidly. In case-worms as well as larval Perlidæ,
Sialidæ, Paraponyx, and Hydrophilidæ the abdominal region is constantly moved
to promote respiration. (Kolbe.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Blood-gills.</b>—Fritz Müller describes in trichopterous larvæ certain
delicate anal tubular processes into which the blood flows, and which
do not as a rule contain tracheæ, though occasionally very fine
tracheal branches. Müller compares them with the gills of crabs
and of shrimps. They are eversible finger-like tubules. They are
used when the tracheal gills are temporarily not available. Their
number varies even in the same genus. There are six in certain
Rhyacophilidæ; five in different Hydropsychidæ; in Macronema
there are four, and they are green when filled with the green blood
of that insect, the tracheal gills being whitish. In the freshly
hatched larva, while the tracheal gills are present, no anal blood-gills
are visible. Similar blood-gills also occur in the pupæ of certain
caddis-flies. (Pictet.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar anal gills filled with blood occur in the larvæ of the fireflies
(Lampyris, etc.), and perhaps, Kolbe thinks, serve for respiration,
though other authors believe them to be adhesive organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larva of Pelobius has true blood-gills. (Schiödte. See p. 461.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The eversible ventral segmental sacs of Scolopendrella, Campodea, and
Machilis, as well as the ventral tube (collophore) of Podura, Smynthurus, etc.,
may, as Oudemans and Haase have suggested, serve a respiratory purpose,
though they lack tracheæ, and differ from blood-gills in containing no gases;
yet the blood is forced into them, causing their eversion. Oudemans observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>that Machilis everted its sacs when the vessel in which it was put was filled with
warm, damp air. The sacs are only thrust out when the creature is completely
at rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Structures referable to blood-gills also occur temporarily in the
embryo of Orthoptera; Rathke observed them in the mole-cricket;
Ayres observed them in <i>Œcanthus niveus</i>, where they form two
stalked broad oval appendages on the first abdominal appendages,
which he regarded as gills. Patten observed them in <i>Phyllodromia
germanica</i>, as pear-shaped structures occurring in the same situation,
but regarded them as sense-organs, as did Cholodkowsky. Graber
found these structures in the embryo of the May-beetle, which looked
like the other embryonic limbs, but survived after the disappearance
of the latter, being longer and broader and unjointed. These disappeared
shortly before birth. In Hydrophilus they remain, Graber
states, after birth. Nussbaum has seen them in Meloë.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, Wheeler has discussed at length these embryonic organs,
which he regards as glandular structures, and calls <i>pleuropodia</i>, their
primitive function having been that of limbs. He has detected them in
the embryo of <i>Periplaneta orientalis</i>, <i>Mantis carolina</i>, <i>Xiphidium ensiferum</i>
(Fig. 387); also in the Hemiptera (<i>Cicada septemdecim</i>, <i>Zaitha
fluminea</i>), and in <i>Sialis infumata</i>. He discards the view that they
were once gills or sense-organs, and concludes that they were glands.
But, as we have suggested, their function once that of gills, and still
respiratory in Synaptera, has perhaps become in the winged insects
glandular and repugnatorial. Instead, then, of being modified
abdominal limbs afterwards serving as glands, as Wheeler claims,
we are inclined to believe that they functioned as blood-gills.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>k.</i> Tracheal gills of adult insects</h4>

<p class='c016'>Tracheal gills are known to be retained by a few insects in the
imago stage, the nymphs in all stages breathing by them. The most
notable example is the perlid genus Pteronarcys, in which, as Newport
states, there are eight sets, comprising 13 pairs of branchial
tufts distributed over the under surface of the thoracic and first two
abdominal segments.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first set, consisting of three pairs of tufts, partly encircling the neck like
a ruff, arises from the soft membrane connecting the head and prosternum.
The thoracic tufts originate between and behind the coxæ, as well as on the
front margin of the meso- and metathoracic segments. The number of filaments
in each tuft varies from about 20 to 50 or more, the densest tufts being those of
the two hinder thoracic segments. Each filament is usually simple, though in a
few cases they are branched (Fig. 457, <i>A</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>The adult Pteronarcys is nocturnal, flying only at dewfall or in the night, and
Mr. Barnston observed it when on the wing, “constantly dipping on the surface
of the water”; by day it hides “in crevices of rocks which are constantly
wetted by the spray of falling water, under stones and in other damp places.”
It may thus be compared with the Amphibians, Necturus and Proteus, whose
gills are retained in adult life. A similar large Chilian Perlid (<i>Diamphipnoa
lichenalis</i> Gerst.) differs in completely lacking the thoracic gills, though there
are four pairs on the abdomen, <i>i.e.</i> a pair on each of the first four segments. In
this form the number of individual filaments in the largest tufts may amount to
about 200.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another Perlid (<i>Dictyopteryx signata</i>) is said by Hagen to have two pairs of
gill-tufts on the under side of the head; the first pair situated on the base of the
submentum, the second on the membrane connecting the
head and prosternum.</p>

<p class='c013'>Kolbe states that in the imagines of <i>Perla marginata</i>
and <i>P. cephalotes</i> on the hinder edge of the thoracic stigmata
arise three very small chitinous plates, which, on their
under side and on the edges are beset with numerous short
white filaments. These completely correspond to the filaments
of the tuft-like larval gills. Persistent anal gills also
occur in the imagines of Perla.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Nemoura lateralis</i> and <i>cinerea</i> the tracheal gills are
differently disposed. On each side
of the anterior edge of the prosternum
arise delicate tightly twisted
filaments, like those of the larva.
(Einführung, p. 536.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Hagen also states that in the
dragon-fly, Euphæa, the gills of the nymphs are retained in the imago, and
Palmén remarks that in Æschna the rectal gills of the nymph persist in the
imago, though not used for respiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>Palmén gives an instance of a caddis-fly (Hydropsyche, Fig. 448) retaining its
gills through the imago stage, but they are unfit for respiration, as they are
minute and shrunken.</p>

<p class='c013'>A walking-stick (<i>Prisopus flabelliformis</i>) found in the mountains of Brazil
has the remarkable habit, according to Murray, of spending “the whole of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>day under water, in a stream or rivulet, fixed firmly to a stone in the rapid part
of the stream,” with its head turned up stream; but leaving the water at dark.
The under side of the body, including the head, is hollowed so that the creature
may adhere, sucker-like, to smooth stones; the claws, claspers, and flaps on the
legs aid in retaining its hold, while the outer margin of the legs is dentate and
thickly fringed with hair to repel the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another form, closely related to Prisopus, from Borneo (<i>Cotylosoma dipneusticum</i>)
is said by Wood-Mason to be even more profoundly modified for an
aquatic life, since it has not only spiracles, but also, as he claims, tracheal gills.
From each side of the body, in fact along the lower margins of the sides of the
metathorax, there stand straight out five equal, small, but conspicuous ciliated oval
plates, “which, when the insect is submerged and its stigmata are closed, doubtless
serve for respiration.” The author did not note the actual presence of
tracheæ in these plates.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>THE ORGANS OF REPRODUCTION</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Insects are without exception unisexual, the male and female
organs existing in different individuals, no insects being normally
hermaphroditic. The reproductive organs are situated in the hind-body
or abdomen, especially near the end, the genital glands opening
externally either in the space between the 7th and 8th, or 8th and
9th, or 9th and 10th abdominal segments, but as a rule between the
8th and 9th segments (Fig. 299).</p>

<p class='c007'>The primary or essential male organs are the testes, those of the
female being the ovaries. As we shall see, the primitive number of
seminal ducts and oviducts was two, this number being still retained
in Lepisma and the Ephemeridæ. The reproductive organs of both
sexes are at first, in their embryonic condition, of the same shape
and structure, becoming differentiated in form and function before
sexual maturity. These glands and ducts have a paired mesodermal
genital rudiment, the ends of the ducts being often connected with
corresponding ectodermal invaginations of the cuticle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secondary sexual organs mainly comprise the external genital
armature of the male, and the egg-laying organs, or ovipositor of
the female. Besides these structures there are other more superficial
secondary sexual characters, such as differences in the size and
ornamentation as well as coloring of the body, or of parts of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The primary sexual organs of insects have been conveniently tabulated
by Kolbe, thus:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. <i>Male reproductive organs.</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>

      <div class='line'>4. Accessory glands.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. The common seminal outlet, with the penis.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>II. <i>Female reproductive organs.</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Two ovaries, with the egg-tubes.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Two oviducts.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Receptaculum seminis; bursa copulatrix.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Accessory sac.</div>
      <div class='line'>5. The common oviduct, vagina, uterus.</div>
      <div class='line'>6. The ovipositor.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The ducts of the sexual glands in Peripatus being transformed nephridia or
segmental organs, it has been inferred that this is also the case with those of
insects, though, as Lang states, there is a considerable difference in the two
cases, as the greater part of the ducts in Peripatus arises out of the ectoderm,
while in the Myriopoda and insects they come from the mesoderm; but he adds
that in the Annelids the greater part of the nephridial duct is of mesodermal
origin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>While in insects there is but a single pair of genital outlets,
the serial arrangement of the testicular (Fig. 458) and egg-tubes
(Fig. 459) in some Thysanura (Campodea, Japyx, and Lepisma),
where the tubes (5 to 7 on each side) open singly one behind the
other in segmental succession, indicates that in their ancestors these
egg-tubes opened out on different segments situated one behind the
other. Each egg-tube independently opens into one of the two
oviducts, which extend through the abdomen as straight canals.
The two oviducts open externally by a short unpaired terminal portion,
which in Machilis is said to be wanting, only the outer aperture
of the two oviducts being in this case common to both. In
Campodea and in the Collembola the ovaries and testes on each side
are simply tubes. It is to be observed that in the young Lepisma
Nassonow found that the external openings of the two ejaculatory
ducts are paired (Fig. 458 <i>B</i>, <i>ed.</i>).</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In the Stylopidæ, also, though this may be the result of adaptation to the
singular parasitic habits of the females whose bodies are mostly situated in the
abdomen of their host, the ends of the oviducts are formed by the invagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>of the integument of the 2d, 3d, and 4th abdominal segments. In the 2d to 5th
segments are situated tubes which open in the cavity of the body with funnel-like
ends, so that the ducts have a close resemblance to the segmental organs of
worms. (Nassonow.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among the winged insects the reproductive organs of the cricket
(Fig. 466) are perhaps as simple as any. The testes are separate,
and the vasa deferentia very long. The seminal vesicles bear
numerous large and short utricles (<i>utriculi majores</i> and <i>breviores</i>),
the penis being simple and dilated
at the end; while in <i>Phyllodromia
germanica</i> the testes are functional
throughout life, and consist
of four lobes each. In the common
cockroach (<i>P. orientalis</i>) (Fig. 461) the testes are functional only in
the young male; they afterwards shrivel and are functionally replaced
by the vesiculæ seminales and their appendages, when the later transformations
of the sperm-cells are effected. The accessory glands are
numerous and differ both in function and insertion. Two sets of
these glands (utriculi majores and breviores) are attached to the
vesiculæ seminales and the fore end of the ejaculatory duct, while
another appendage, called by Miall and Denny the <i>conglobate gland</i>,
opens separately on the exterior upon a double hook, which forms a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>part of the external genital armature. The so-called penis is long,
slender, and dilated at the end, but is not perforated.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the locusts (Acrydiidæ) the testes are, unlike those of most
other Orthoptera, closely united to each other so as to form a single
mass of tubular glands into which penetrate both simple and dilated
tracheæ; the entire mass is situated in the 3d, 4th, and 5th
abdominal segments,
and above the intestine.
The anterior
end of the testicular
mass is rounded and
held in place by a
broad, thin band, one
on each side; two
similar bands are
situated a little behind
the middle of
the mass. From the
under side, and a
little in advance of
the middle of the
mass, two straight
small ducts, as long
as the testicular mass,
pass obliquely to the
sides of the body,
at the posterior end
of the 7th segment of
the abdomen; these
are the vasa deferentia.
Each vas deferens,
with its mate,
forms a convoluted
mass of tubes, comprising
twenty folded
bundles (<i>epididymis</i> of Dufour), and two single, long, convoluted
tubes, the <i>vesiculæ seminales</i>, which are lobed in the 6th and 7th
segments of the abdomen. The two vesiculæ unite over the 5th
abdominal ganglion, forming a thick, very short canal (<i>ductus
ejaculatorius</i>), which passes into a large spherical muscular mass
(præputium), behind which is the large intromittent organ (<i>penis</i>),
which forms a short chitinous cylinder, quite complicated in structure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>being armed with hooks and projections and affording excellent
specific characters. It can be seen in place without dissection by
drawing back the orbicular convex piece called the <i>velum penis</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Hymenoptera the reproductive system is quite simple, as
seen in Fig. 462.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The general shape and relations of the female reproductive organs
are seen in Fig. 298, of the locust (Acrydiidæ). The ovaries consist
of two large bundles of tubes, each bundle tied to the other by slight
bands, with air-sacs and tracheæ ramifying among them. These tubes
extend along the intestine, passing into the prothorax.
The ovarian tubes opening into the
oviducts unite to form the vagina, which lies
on the floor of the abdomen. (In the cockroach
the vagina has a muscular wall and chitinous
lining.) Above the opening of the duct, and
directly communicating with it, is the copulatory
pouch (<i>bursa copulatrix</i>), a capacious pocket lined
within with several narrow, longitudinal, chitinous
bands. Behind the bursa copulatrix lies,
partly resting under the fifth abdominal ganglion,
the sebific, cement, or colleterial gland
(<i>colleterium</i>; compare Fig. 299, <i>sb</i>), which is
flattened, pear-shaped, a little over half as long
as a ripe egg of the same insect. From the
under side, a little in advance of the middle,
arises the sebific duct, which, after making three
tight coils next to the ganglion, passes back and
empties into the upper side of the bursa copulatrix,
dilating slightly before its junction with the
latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most primitive type of reproductive organs observed in insects
is that of the young Lepisma and the Ephemeridæ, in which the
outlets of the oviducts and of the vasa deferentia respectively are
double or paired, showing that insects have probably inherited these
structures from the segmental organs of their vermian ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Réaumur had already observed the process of oviposition and seen
that the female Ephemera had two openings near the end of the
“6th” abdominal segment, from which he saw two masses of eggs
pass out at a time (Fig. 463). Eaton afterwards (1871) referred to
the oviducts as terminating between the 7th and 8th segments of the
abdomen, and after him Joly; but for a detailed monograph on the
subject we are indebted to Palmén. He found that the outlets of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>the sexual glands are paired, not only in the larvæ of all stages, but
also in the imagines, and in both sexes. In the males the vasa deferentia
pass on the ventral side of the 9th segment through two
external appendages, both reproductive organs, at whose tips or sides
the openings are situated. In the larvæ the female openings are
not formed until after the last moult. In the females the two oviducts
open on the ventral side of the hind-body between the 7th and
8th segments.</p>

<div  class='figleft id033'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Palmén suggests that the Ephemerids represent, in respect to the
reproductive system among insects, a very primitive type of organization,
and he concludes that the inner sexual organs of insects are
built up of two different morphological elements; <i>i.e.</i> (<i>a</i>) internal
primitive paired structures (testes with vasa deferentia, ovaria with
oviducts), and (<i>b</i>) integumental structures,
such as the ductus ejaculatorius and
vagina.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the younger larvæ the vasa deferentia
form slender cords along which are situated
the seminal glands; these cords are inserted
in the integument on the hinder edge of
the 9th sternite, where afterwards, during
the last moult, the copulatory organs grow
out. In the older larvæ the sperm collects
in the cavities of these cords. Their walls
become expanded, and this section then
functions as vesiculæ seminales. The ends of the cords remain contracted
and act as ductus ejaculatorii. Common unpaired glandular
structures are not present. At the last moult the copulatory organs
reach their complete development, and the ducts become open
externally.</p>

<p class='c007'>The oviducts in the larva are at first slender, string-like, and
bear the egg-follicles. As soon as the eggs pass out of the follicles
and collect in the oviducts, the walls of the latter become stretched,
and this portion forms two uterus-like structures. The terminal
division of the two passages forms their vaginal portions. But since
there is no common vagina, there are no unpaired glands and no
receptaculum seminis. The two ducts become open after the last
shedding of the skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palmén adds that this paired or double nature of the sexual glands
and their external ducts in this group of insects occurs in some Myriopoda
(Fig. 3, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>) and a few Arachnida (Fig. 3, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, the outlets
being in this class unpaired), numerous Crustacea, and most worms;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>and as already stated it is very marked in Limulus, where the paired
outlets are in both sexes very simple and wide apart (Fig. 3, <i>A</i>). In
the worms the paired genital ducts are modified segmental organs.
As we have seen, in the young male Lepisma there are two male
genital openings. Hence this double nature of the genital passages
in the may-flies seems to be very primitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Dermaptera, also, the genus Labidura was found by Meinert
to have two independent ductus ejaculatorii, opening externally in
double external slit-like processes (<i>penes</i>). The two ducts arise
from a single seminal vesicle, which is either paired (<i>L. advena</i>), or
forms a common passage (<i>L. gigantea</i>). In Forficula (Fig. 464, <i>B</i>)
only one ejaculatory duct persists, the other is obliterated, and one
of the penes is atrophied, the other assuming a position in the middle
line of the body. Thus the single ejaculatory duct and seminal
vesicle arise from the primitive vasa deferentia, and not from the
integument of the body, as is the case in the following examples.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to the researches of Dufour, Loew, etc., most species of Orthoptera
(Œdipoda), Libellula, Perla, Panorpa, Rhaphidia, Myrmeleon, Sialis, and Trichoptera
(Hydropsyche) have double vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles, and
two ejaculatory ducts. The male genital passages of Rhaphidia have a double
opening, Loew describing “the two seminal vesicles as lying near each other and
at last uniting in a common passage, with an external opening, which, however,
must be very short, since I could only once clearly observe it.” This opening
is a deep invagination of the external integument, at the bottom of which the
two ducts open independently of each other. In such insects, Palmén states
that the single ejaculatory duct morphologically arises by an invagination of the
integument.</p>

<p class='c013'>In another group, forming, as regards the genital apparatus, a step next above
the Ephemeridæ, viz. the Perlidæ, the oviducts open near each other at the
bottom of a median single “vagina,” situated between the 7th and 8th abdominal
segment; it is covered beneath by a valve-like, enlarged sternite of the
preceding segment, and Palmén homologizes it with the ovi-valvula of some
Ephemeridæ. He regards this bell-shaped vagina as a cup-like, deep, intersegmental
fold, which projects into the body-cavity and there receives the two
ducts.</p>

<p class='c013'>This differentiation in the Perlidæ may be regarded as the type for several
groups of insects. But in others occur a complication which in some degree
modifies the type. Thus the invagination arises out from one segment alone,
but several segments during metamorphosis may become so reduced that the
ventral portions of all may be invaginated to form the vagina. Thus in the
larva of Corethra, according to Leydig, and also Weismann, the two testes are
attached by two cords to the integument; the hinder ones are inserted independently,
and share in the development of the outlets.</p>

<p class='c013'>Graber has observed the same relations in the pupa of Chironomus, the efferent
genital tubes in both sexes being separate, so that there are two vaginal passages
and two penes present. Palmén comments on these relations in the dipterous
insects, remarking that during metamorphosis certain parts of the terminal abdominal
segments are reduced, while others are hypertrophied; hence the points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>of insertion of the cords referred to becoming the openings of the vasa are carried
within the abdomen; and this part of the integument becomes an unpaired
section. In these insects, also, there is an unpaired vesicula seminalis, but its
morphological nature (whether formed from the integumental duct or the fused
vasa deferentia) can only be settled after special investigation.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Lepidoptera, also, it has been shown by Herold, Suckow, Bessels, and
recently with full details by Jackson, that the paired larval oviducts are at first
solid, but become tubular early in pupal life. A little later, their cavities open
into that of the azygos or unpaired oviduct. The paired oviducts open in the
female caterpillars on the hind edge of the 7th abdominal segment, afterwards
uniting with the unpaired vagina of the 8th segment, which is developed from
the hypodermis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jackson adds that there are three stages traceable in the evolution of the
genital ducts of Lepidoptera: “an ephemeridal stage, which ends towards the
close of larval life; an orthopteran stage, indicated during the quiescent period
preceding pupation; and a lepidopteran stage, which begins with the commencement
of pupal life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a summary of these results it appears that the genital organs
of insects consist of two morphologically different elements: 1. the
primitive internal paired structures (testes with the vasa deferentia;
ovaries with the ovarian tubes), and 2. integumental structures
(Fig. 464). In the most primitive winged insects (Ephemeridæ) the
latter structures are only represented by the two external sexual
openings, the entire reproductive system being paired. The paired
parts become in the more highly differentiated forms united into
single parts, while, <i>a</i>, a common integumental division, grows in,
forming the ductus ejaculatorius, or the vagina; or, <i>b</i>, the inner passages
anastomose together, <i>i.e.</i> the openings fuse together; or, <i>c</i>, both
of these cases occur at once; or, finally, we have <i>d</i>, where the superfluous
paired parts by reduction become single.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The male ducts open behind the 9th, the female passages of
Ephemerids behind the 7th abdominal segment, those of other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>insects behind the 8th, except in the Stylopidæ (Strepsiptera), in
which they open much in front.</p>

<p class='c007'>Figure 464 graphically shows their relation. In the Odonata (<i>F</i>)
the chitinous lining or integumental invagination extends inwards
where the two oviducts begin, in the Coleoptera (<i>E</i>) the vagina,
bursa copulatrix, and receptaculum seminis being lined by a thick
chitinous layer. While in Perla the two seminal ducts pass directly
into the copulatory organ, in the Coleoptera they open into the
unpaired ductus ejaculatorius at a distance from the copulatory
organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The morphological results obtained by Palmén, and for the
Lepidoptera by Jackson, were apparently confirmed from an embryological
point of view by Nusbaum, from observations on the
development of the sexual passages in two genera of Pediculidæ,
and are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. The prevalent impression that the larval ducts unite with each other and
give origin to the whole system of sexual ducts is incorrect; they form only
the vasa deferentia or the oviducts.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. All other parts of the efferent apparatus (uterus, vagina, receptaculum
seminis, ductus ejaculatorius, penis, and appended glands) develop from the
hypodermis.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. The connective tissue and the musculature of the efferent apparatus are
derived from mesoblast cells present in the body-cavity.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. The efferent ducts originate as paired rudiments. All unpaired (azygos)
parts (uterus, penis, receptaculum seminis, unpaired glands, etc.) are at first
paired. The unpaired efferent apparatus of insects must therefore be regarded
as morphologically a secondary and more complicated form.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>5. The male and female efferent ducts are strictly homologous.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. The cavities of the oviducts, uterus, vagina in the female, of the vasa
deferentia, appended organs, and ductus ejaculatorius of the male arise independently,
and come into connection secondarily.</p>

<p class='c013'>The presence of two genital openings, viz. a bursa copulatrix or copulatory
pouch, and of the primitive oviducal orifice behind the 9th segment, is peculiar
to Lepidoptera, and the inquiry naturally arises whether they represent the
outlets of two pairs of segmental organs. The question has been fully set at
rest, however, by Jackson, who shows that the copulatory pouch is a secondary
invagination of the ectoderm, being derived from the hypodermis, while the
second aperture is a special adaptation. It is, however, the partial homologue
of the vaginal orifice in other orders of insects. It opens behind the sternite of
the 8th abdominal segment, the typical position of the vaginal aperture as
shown by Lacaze-Duthiers. The lateral position of the bursa and its separation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>from the azygos oviduct are probably late features in the phylogenetic history
of the Lepidoptera, subsequent even to the closure of the furrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The existence of a second or posterior aperture is probably to be attributed
to the advantage gained by a terminal position for the aperture through which
the ova are laid. The remarkable way in which this aperture shifts backwards
seems to point very distinctly to this explanation, especially as the Lepidoptera
are entirely devoid of the outgrowths which form the ovipositor in some orders;
<i>e.g.</i> most Orthoptera.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The original condition of things appears to have been retained in a moth,
<i>Nematois metallicus</i>, which, according to Cholodkowsky, possesses but a single
external aperture, the bursa opening into the dorsal wall of the unpaired oviduct.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The male organs of reproduction</h4>

<p class='c016'>Bearing in mind that the testes with their efferent ducts are, like
the ovaries and egg-tubes, primitive structures, there are various
secondary or adaptive structures which are either due (1) to modifications
of the male efferent ducts, or of the ovarian tubes, or (2) to
various accessory organs, mostly glandular, resulting from the invagination
of the ectoderm.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The male organs are, then, the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Two testes (Figs. 465–469, <i>t</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>ho</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The two seminal ducts (<i>vasa deferentia</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>sl</i>, <i>SL</i>), whose lower
or outer (distal) division becomes enlarged and acts as a seminal
vesicle (<i>vesicula seminalis</i>; Figs. 467–469, <i>bl</i>, <i>SB</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The common ejaculatory duct (<i>ductus ejaculatorius</i>), with the
penis (Figs. 467–469, <i>ag</i>, <i>uSG</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Accessory glands at the base of the vasa deferentia (<i>glandulæ
mucosæ</i>, Figs. 465–469, <i>a. g.</i>, <i>dr</i>, <i>D</i>), whose secretion mixes with the
semen or serves for the formation of the seminal packets (sematophores).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>In his paper on the internal male organs of beetles, Escherich states that
those of the Carabidæ illustrate the simplest, most primitive condition (Fig. 465).
A simple blind tube on each side produces spermatozoa, stores the elements,
and secretes mucus. Each of these tubes opens into a somewhat larger duct,
and the two unite in a common ejaculatory canal. The terminal portion in
these beetles is lined with chitin, and is therefore ectodermal, and not the result
of the union of the mesodermic vasa deferentia. The region corresponding to
the testes, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles are mesodermic. Blaps (Fig.
465, <i>B</i>) is intermediate between the Carabidæ and Hydrophilus (Fig. 465, <i>C</i>).
The accessory glands (<i>a. g.</i>) are developed, and the seminal vesicles are situated
in the middle, and not at the lower end of the vasa deferentia, as in Hydrophilus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The testes.</b>—Each testis is composed of follicles or corresponding
parts, which according to the group of insects in which they occur
are united in different ways; or each testis consists of a single hank
or skein-like blind tube which is enveloped by a membrane, as in
the Carabidæ, Dyticidæ, or Lucanidæ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The number of testicular tubes is small in most Hemiptera, but
very great in the Cicadidæ, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and many
Hymenoptera. Although the testes are usually separated from each
other, they are closely united in certain Orthoptera (Gryllotalpa,
Ephippigera), Coleoptera (Galerucella), in many Lepidoptera, and
in a number of Hymenoptera (Scolia, Pompilus, Crabro, and others).</p>

<p class='c007'>The two testes of most Lepidoptera are so closely grown together
or coalesced into a single body that one might regard them as a
single testis. But in the different families there occur all grades,
from the unpaired testes of most Lepidoptera to Hepialus with separate
testes. Cholodkowsky therefore distinguishes four types:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. The embryonal or primitive type, with two testes, whose seminal follicles
are entirely separate. (Brandt.) These testes are contained, as in all other
Lepidoptera, in a well-developed thick chitinous membrane or scrotum, analogous
to that of the higher vertebrates, which envelops each separate seminal
follicle (<i>Hepialus humuli</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>2. The larval type, with two testes, whose four follicles are enclosed by a
common scrotal membrane (<i>Bombyx mori</i>, <i>Gastropacha quercifolia</i>, <i>Ichthyura
anachoreta</i> and <i>anastomosis</i>, <i>Saturnia pyri</i>, <i>Aglia tau</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>3. The pupal type (since it first occurs in the pupa state), with a single testis,
which possesses an external median lace-like covering. (Adela, Lycæna.)</p>

<p class='c013'>4. The imaginal type, with a single testis enveloped by a lace-like scrotum,
within which the follicles are wound around the longitudinal axis of the testis.
(Most Lepidoptera.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In Nematois there are twenty seminal follicles, the number of ovarian tubes
being the same. (Cholodkowsky.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In many insects the testes are not composed of tubes (follicles), but of button-like
bodies, each of which has its own duct.</p>

<p class='c013'>The color of the testes is usually white, but they may be orange (Decticus),
yellowish green (<i>Locusta viridissima</i>), or deep yellow (Chrysopa).</p>

<p class='c013'>The testes of Asilid flies are enveloped by a common dark-red membrane
rich in tracheæ, like that in Lepidoptera which clothes the separate testicular
follicles. The two testes of Calliphora are enveloped by an orange-yellow capsule,
outside of which is a special membrane formed by the fat-body. (Cholodkowsky.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In the honey-bee the testis has two envelopes, the outer of which is formed
by the fat-body, the inner coat of connective tissue. The entire testis corresponds
to a portion only of that of <i>Bombyx mori</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The seminal ducts.</b>—The vasa deferentia are fine tubes, which vary
much in length; being short in many beetles and locusts, very short
in many Diptera (Syrphidæ, etc.), very long in Cicada and many
beetles; according to Burmeister, being in Dyticus
about five times, in Necrophorus and Blaps eight to
ten times, in Cicada 14 times, in <i>Cetonia aurata</i> 30
times, as long as the body. They either resemble
a skein of silk, or form a
tangled mass.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal or lower
end of the vasa is in
many insects dilated
into a sac or seminal
vesicle, which serves for
the reception and storage
of the seminal fluid
after it passes through
the vasa deferentia. In the honey-bee the vas deferens is given off
from the reservoir, forms loops in and outside of the testis, and
passes to the seminal vesicle. The canal into which the vesicle
narrows does not open into the ductus ejaculatorius, but into the
glandulæ mucosæ; its epithelial cells are much vacuolated, and
have, therefore, a spongy appearance. (Koschewnikoff.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The ejaculatory duct</b> during coition conducts the sperm
into the copulatory pouch of the female. In consequence
of the stretching of the integumental membrane
the end of the duct can be erected and again withdrawn.
For this purpose the end of the duct is thickened and
is said to be provided with powerful muscles. The
evaginable terminal portion is covered by a strong chitinous
membrane forming the penis or intromittent organ
(Fig: 462, <i>h</i>), which is externally enveloped by a pair of
chitinous lobes, which in many beetles are converted into
a capsule. The ductus ejaculatorius of the honey-bee is
inserted by two chitinous branches into the point of
union of the two glandulæ mucosæ; it and the entire
copulatory apparatus are devoid of muscles, though it is,
however, well developed beneath the mucous glands.
(Koschewnikoff.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The accessory glands</b> of the vasa deferentia are tubes
whose secretions either directly mix with the semen,
or in many cases form seminal packets (<i>spermatophores</i>).
In Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera there is usually
one pair. In many insects there are several pairs, as in
Hydrophilidæ and Elateridæ; they are branched in
Hemiptera, and in Orthoptera bushy. The single
glandular tubules are very long, and form a skein-like
mass. In Orthoptera, in the larger number
of accessory glands, two forms may be distinguished,
which differ from each other in their
contents (Siebold). In the cockroach (Fig. 461)
these glands form the “mushroom” shaped gland
of Huxley, which was at first regarded as the
testis.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The spermatozoa.</b>—These very minute bodies,
the sexual homologues of the eggs, abound in the
seminal fluid, and are formed in the follicles of the
testes from a germinal layer or epithelium, as are
the eggs. They are hair- or thread-like, usually
consisting of a head, a body or middle-piece, and
a long, thread-like tail (flagellum), which vibrates
rapidly, causing the spermatozoön to move actively
forwards (Fig. 470).</p>

<p class='c013'>In beetles, according to Ballowitz, there are two main
types of spermatozoa, connected, however, by intermediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>forms. There is a double-tailed type, already described by Bütschli and v. la
Valette St. George, and there are others which are single-tailed. Bütschli
showed that in the double spermatozoön one tail-filament is straight and stiff,
the other being undulating and contractile. Ballowitz describes this type in
Calathus (Fig. 470, <i>B</i>), Chrysomela, and Hylobius, etc., and shows that the
straight or supporting portion of the tail is elastic, but somewhat stiff, resistant
to reagents, and without any fibrillar structure, while the contractile fringe
consists of an extremely complicated system of fibrils (Fig. 470). The single-tailed
type of spermatozoön, as seen, <i>e.g.</i>, in Melolontha and Hydrophilus, has
no supporting fibres. The tail is twisted in a spiral, corresponds to the contractile
fringe of the double type, and exhibits a complicated fibrillar structure.
The fringed type works its way ahead like the screw of a steamer.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Each spermatozoön is a modified but complete cell, and the nucleus
contains the chromatin, a deeply staining substance of the nuclear
network and of the chromosomes
and the supposed bearer of heredity.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the spermatozoön.</b>—It
arises from a primordial germcell
called <i>spermatogonium</i>. This
cell contains a large, pale nucleus
and a dark body, the accessory nucleus
of Bütschli. The <i>spermatogonia</i>
subdivide, but at a certain
period pause in their subdivisions,
and undergo considerable growth.
“Each spermatogonium is thus
converted into a <i>spermatocyte</i>,
which, by two rapidly succeeding
divisions gives rise to four spermatozoa,
as follows: The primary
spermatocyte first divides to form
two daughter-cells, known as spermatocytes
of the second order,
or sperm mother-cells. Each of
these divides again—as a rule
without pausing, and without the
reconstruction of the daughter-nuclei—to form two <i>spermatids</i> or
sperm-cells. Each of the four spermatids is then directly transformed
into a single spermatozoön; its nucleus becoming very small
and compact, its cytoplasm giving rise to the tail and to certain
other structures.... As the spermatid develops into the spermatozoön,
it assumes an elongated form, the nucleus lying at one end,
while the cytoplasm is drawn out to form the flagellum at the opposite
end.” (Wilson’s The Cell, from La Valette St. George.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>Henking finds that the primordial sperm-cells correspond to the
primordial ova, both forms of cells in the insect he studied containing
the characteristic number of twenty-four chromosomes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The spermatogenesis of Laphria, according to Cholodkowsky, is very peculiar,
and strongly resembles that described by Verson in <i>Bombyx mori</i>. In the
blind end of the testicular tubes lies a colossal cell visible to the naked eye, the
spermatogone, from which the entire contents of the testes originate. In Bombyx
this spermatogone appears in the larva state. Such colossal spermatogones
also occur in Lepidoptera of different families (Hyponomeuta, Vanessa, and in
the pupa of <i>Chareas graminis</i>), in Trichoptera, and in Hemiptera (Syromastes);
and Cholodkowsky inquires whether they may not be typical of insects. Toyama
has observed these colossal cells not only in the testes but also in the ovaries of
the silkworm. He regards them as supporting cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spermatozoa are inclined to remain in bundles, and in this
state are expelled during copulation. These bundles are either root-like,
bushy, string-like, sinuous, or worm-like.</p>

<p class='c013'>Auerbach has observed the spermatozoa of <i>Dyticus marginalis</i> in their passage
through the convoluted seminal vesicles. All those arising from one testicular
tube are united in a bundle. Each has a very complex structure, bilateral but
unsymmetrical. The right side of the head is concave, the left convex; the
whole head is longitudinally curved to right or left; and on the posterior half of
the right side there is a projecting ridge bearing a hook-shaped cyanophilous
“anchor,” at the free end of which an erythrophilous spherule appears. The
most remarkable fact is that the spermatozoa unite in pairs in a perfectly definite
way, opposed and crossed in a manner somewhat suggestive of a pair of scissors,
with the right sides of the heads in contact. During this conjugation, or “dejugation”
as Auerbach calls it, the anchors change their shape, and the little
spherules are lost. Hundreds of these double spermatozoa are found together in
little balls. The conjugation is a temporary one, but it may permit a molecular
exchange of substance, perhaps with the result of mixing the hereditary qualities
and limiting variability. (Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc., 1893, p. 622.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In many insects which lack a true penis, the bundle of spermatozoa
are united in the ejaculatory duct, forming packets which are enveloped
by the secretion of the accessory glands which stiffens into
a hard case. These packets are called <i>spermatophores</i>. They are
either introduced into the vagina of the female or simply remain outside.
Graber has repeatedly observed that the male crickets, in the
absence of the female, let their spermatophores fall to the earth;
whether it is afterwards made available is not known, because
hitherto no case is reported that females seeking impregnation
search, as in the case of the Isopod crustacean, Porcellio, for the
spermatophores.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Gryllidæ and Locustidæ the spermatophore lies in a cup-like cavity
under the penis. This is called the “spermatophore cup” (Chadima, 1871),
into which the ejaculatory duct of the testis opens.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>According to the views of Schneider, the spermatophores, with their capsule,
usually consist solely of seminal filaments, which stick closely to each other,
and only exceptionally have a capsule formed by a glandular secretion. In
Locusta, however, and perhaps also in Gryllus, the sperm is enveloped by the
secretion of the accessory glands of the seminal ducts; the spermatophores
pass, still fluid, out of the sexual opening of the male into that of the female,
but become chilled on the outer surface, so that the sperm, without coming in
contact with the air, passes into the receptaculum seminis.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mode of grouping of the spermatozoa of the Locustidæ as they occur in
the spermatheca of the female is remarkable. Their heads lie so close to each
other that they form a long shaft, while the numerous threads are arranged so as
to look like the two vanes of a feather, the entire mass being like a very long
heron’s feather. (Siebold.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In the honey-bee the spermatophore is likewise enveloped by the secretion of
the accessory glands, and thereby becomes a sort of seminal cartridge. This is a
peculiar oval body which is carried during the marriage-flight into the air within
the upper part of the penis, the so-called penis-bulb. (Leuckart.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The female organs of reproduction</h4>

<p class='c016'>The different parts of the female reproductive organs are the
following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The two ovaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The two oviducts.</p>

<div  class='figleft id012'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>3. The common egg-passage in nearly all insects (its distal or
hindermost part forming the uterus
or vagina).</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The receptaculum seminis, or
spermatheca.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The bursa copulatrix, or copulatory
pouch.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The accessory glands (cement,
sebific, or colleterial glands, or “oil
reservoirs,” glandulæ sebaceæ, coleterium).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The ovaries and the ovarian tubes.</b>—As
in the testes, so each ovary
consists of a variable number of
ovarian tubes, by some called <i>ovarioles</i>,
united by a thread at the distal
end, and at the lower or hinder
end opening into the oviduct. Each
ovarian or egg tube is divided into
three sections: (1) the terminal
thread; (2) the terminal chamber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>and (3) the actual ovarian tube, or chambered main division, this
forming the longest part of the egg-tube.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slender terminal thread serves to attach or suspend each egg-tube
near the dorsal vessel (not directly to the heart, as formerly
supposed), becoming lost in the fat-body.</p>

<div  class='figright id013'>
<img src='images/i_521.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 473.</span>—Ovarian tube of <i>P. orientalis</i>: <i>A</i>, section near the end; <i>tf</i>, base of terminal filament. <i>B</i>, section lower down; <i>ec</i>, egg-cells in egg-chamber.—After Brandt.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The terminal chamber contains undifferentiated cell elements, supposed
to be the remains of the ovarian rudiments. From these arise
(either in the embryo or larva) first, the follicle epithelium of the
ovarian tubes; and, second, the material for the
formation of the new eggs, and nutritive cells.
“In the terminal chamber these cell-elements remain
undifferentiated, excepting when required for
the removal of the follicle epithelium, eggs, and
nutritive cells in the adult insect.” (Lang.) This
portion of the ovariole is called the <i>germarium</i>. In
Blatta it is filled with protoplasm in which numerous
small nuclei are imbedded. (Wheeler.)
The chambered main division of the egg-tube
contains the ripening eggs, one in each compartment,
the tube appearing like a string of beads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The egg-tubes are of two types: (1) those without,
and (2) those with nutritive cells, the first
kind being the simplest, and occurring in the
Synaptera (except Campodea) and in Orthoptera.
As an example may be cited that of the cockroach
(Fig. 473), where in each tube there is a simple
continuous row of eggs from the terminal chamber
to the oviduct. The tube being constricted
between these consecutive eggs, gives it a beaded
appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the cockroach (<i>Periplaneta orientalis</i>) each egg-tube
has a beaded appearance. Its wall consists of a transparent
elastic membrane, lined by epithelium, with an
external peritoneal layer of connective tissue. The terminal
filament (<i>tf</i>) is filled with a clear protoplasm, with a few nuclei. In
the terminal chamber (<i>tc</i>) are large nucleated cells, with separate nuclei,
both entangled in a network of protoplasm. In the third, or egg-chamber
(<i>ec</i>), are about twenty ripening eggs, arranged in a single row. “Between
and around the eggs the nuclei gradually arrange themselves into one-layered
follicles, which are attached, not to the wall of the tubes, but to the eggs, and
travel downwards with them. As the eggs descend, the yolk which they contain
increases rapidly, and the germinal vesicle and spot (nucleus and nucleolus),
which were at first plain, disappear. A vitelline membrane is secreted by the
inner surface and a chitinous chorion by the outer surface of the egg-follicle.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>“The lowest egg in an ovarian tube is nearly or altogether of the full size;
it is of elongate-oval figure, and slightly curved, the convexity being turned
towards the uterus. It is filled with a clear albuminous fluid, which mainly
consists of yolk. The chorion now forms a transparent yellowish capsule, which,
under the microscope, appears to be divided up into very many polygonal areas,
defined by rows of fine dots. These areas probably correspond to as many
follicular cells.” (Brandt, from Miall and Denny.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In the second type, <i>i.e.</i> those egg-tubes with nutritive cells, there are two
kinds. In the first the egg-chambers and yolk- or nutritive chambers alternate,
each of the latter containing one or more nutritive cells, which serve for
the nourishment of the ripening egg contained in the neighboring chamber.
“The egg- and yolk-chambers may be distinctly separated externally by constrictions
(Hymenoptera and many Coleoptera), or one nutritive and one
egg-chamber may lie in each section of the ovarian tube, which is externally
visible as a swelling (Lepidoptera, Diptera).”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the second kind with nutritive cells, the actual tube consists (Fig. 474, <i>C</i>)
of ovarian chambers only; the nutritive cells here remain massed together in
the large terminal chamber. The single egg in the tube is united with the
terminal chamber by connective strands (<i>d. s.</i>), which convey the nutritive
material to the eggs. (Lang.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Egg-cells, nutritive cells, and the cells of the follicle-epithelium (epithelium of
the chambers of the ovarian tubes) are, says Lang, according to their origin,
similar elements, like the egg and yolk-cells of the flat worms (Platodes); division
of labor leads to their later differentiation. Only a few of the numerous
egg-germs develop into eggs, the rest serving as envelopes and as food for these few.</p>

<p class='c013'>Korschelt considers that all the chief elements of the egg-tubes, viz. egg,
nutritive, and epithelial cells, arise by a direct transformation of the elements of
the terminal chamber, and that the last may be traced to the indifferent elements
of the terminal thread, the elements in question originating from the nuclear
elements by a breaking down of the syncytium (or masses of protoplasm with
nuclei scattered through it) composing it (Fig. 475).</p>

<p class='c013'>The latest work is that of Wielowiejski (Zoologische Anzeiger, ix, 1886, p.
132), whose observations are based on a study of the ovarian tubes and the growing
eggs of the Hemiptera (Pyrrhocoris), the Coleoptera (Telephorus, Saperda,
Cetonia and Melolontha, Carabidæ, and Hydradephaga), etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wielowiejski divides the ovaries of insects into three groups:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. Comprising such ovaries in the ends of whose egg-tubes (terminal filament)
the embryonal cells in the early stages are accumulated, and are transformed
into egg-, yolk-, and epithelial cells respectively. (Ovaries of Orthoptera, geodephagous
and hydradephagous Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera).</p>

<p class='c013'>2. Comprising ovaries whose ends above the egg-cells and egg-germs (<i>Eianlagen</i>)
possess throughout life a more or less voluminous solid accumulation of
cells (terminal chamber), but which stand in no close relation with the first.
(Ovaries of Coleoptera, with the exception of the Geodephaga and Hydradephaga,
and Aphidæ in part.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the egg is ripe
the food-chamber disappears
because its
contents have served
for the formation of
the egg below it. In
Lepidoptera especially,
the egg-tubes resemble
strings of pearls because
most of the numerous
eggs ripen
simultaneously and are
likewise deposited at
the same period, which
is naturally not the
case in those insects
whose eggs gradually
ripen (Fig. 477). In
other cases the egg- or
food-compartments are
transformed into each
other, but only one egg- and one food-compartment can be situated
in the same dilatation of the ovarian tube. Finally, there are insects
in whose egg-tubes the egg-compartments are
arranged in a single row, while the capacious
terminal chamber contains a large mass of
food-cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>Egg-cells, nutritive cells, as well as the
cells of the follicle epithelium (epithelium of
the chambers of the ovarian tubes), originate
as similar or homologous elements, division of
labor leading to their later differentiation.
Only a few of the numerous egg-germs develop
into eggs, the rest serving as envelopes
and also as food for these few. (Lang.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In many insects the egg-tubes open into an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>egg-calyx (Fig. 478, <i>c</i>), in which the ripe eggs collect before passing
into the oviduct (<i>ov</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>As the result of his investigations on the origin of the cellular elements of the
ovaries of insects Korschelt concludes:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. The different cell-elements of the egg-tubes, eggs, nutritive cells, and
epithelium arise from identical undifferentiated elements situated in the contents
of the earliest germ of the egg-tubes.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. The first formation of the cellular elements present, and the differentiation
of the individual compartments of the egg-tube, occur during embryonic and
larval life.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. The undifferentiated elements of the terminal chamber correspond to the
embryonic condition, while in post-embryonic time, and even during imaginal
life, a new formation of the different kinds of cells takes place.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. The mode of origin of the different kinds of cells from the undifferentiated
elements varies greatly in different insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. From their histological nature, and from the mode of origin of their
elements, the most complex egg-tubes and those provided with nutritive
compartments are phylogenetically derived from those without such nutritive
compartments.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. The nutritive cells in certain cases originate in the same way and at the
same time as the germ-cells, and are therefore to be regarded as germ-cells
which have abandoned the function of egg-making, and exchanged it for the
production of nutritive material.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. In the egg-tubes with numerous nutritive compartments the nutritive cells
can originate at the same place as the egg-cells, and they afterwards still lie
intermingled with these in the beginning or upper part of the egg-tubes.</p>

<p class='c013'>8. While the capability of egg-making of the germ-cells originally situated in
the extremity of the terminal chamber gradually becomes transferred to those
at the base of the terminal chamber, and the first transform into nutritive cells,
egg-tubes with nutritive compartments at the base may be found.</p>

<p class='c013'>9. The nutritive cells of certain forms arise independently of the germ-cells
and therefore could not have previously originated from them.</p>

<p class='c013'>10. The epithelium has in all forms nearly the same mode of formation; it
everywhere shows a close similarity to the undifferentiated elements of the
terminal chamber, out of which it directly develops. As to the fact of formation
of epithelium through the germ-vesicles (<i>Keimblaschen</i>), nutritive-cell
nuclei, or the so-called “oöblasts,” I could not feel certain.</p>

<p class='c013'>11. Neither the eggs of Hemiptera or of other insects arise through the
agency of “oöblasts,” but like the epithelial and nutritive cells arise by a
gradual differentiation from the indifferent elements of the ovarian tubes.</p>

<p class='c013'>12. The different elements of the egg-tubes, also the eggs, have the morphological
value of cells.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Origin of incipient eggs in the germ of the testes.</b>—Heymons has detected in
the germ of the testes of the male larvæ of <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i> 7 mm. in
length, young or incipient eggs, similar to those seen in the ovarian tubes of
the female larva of the same size. In another male larva of the same size also
occurred short cylindrical tubes each with a terminal thread, which had the
appearance of rudimentary egg-tubes. Hence he thinks that every part of the
genital germs (<i>Anlagen</i>) in the male, which are not concerned in the formation
of testicular follicles, represents the germ of a female genital gland. As is well
known, no insects are hermaphroditic, but this case of the practical origin of
eggs and egg-tubes in the lowest division of the male efferent passage, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>homologous with the egg-producing division of the female ovarian tubes, points
back to hermaphroditic ancestors. And Heymons suggests that the frequent
occurrence of hermaphroditism in insects probably confirms this view.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The bursa copulatrix.</b>—The copulatory pouch in most insects is
a special cup-shaped appendage of the vagina adapted for the
reception of the male organ during sexual union. Its mode of
formation in the cockroach
is thus described
by Haase:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the retreat of the
female sexual aperture,
situated in the 8th ventral
plate, a considerable
space, the genital pouch,
is produced; this is
formed chiefly by the
extended connective membrane
between the elongated
7th and 8th ventral
plates. This serves for
the development of the
egg-cocoon, which is retained
by the internal
appendages of the posterior
gonapophyses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fertilization of the
female takes place once
for all a long time previous
to oviposition; the
semen in the receptaculum
seminis passes out as
the eggs slip down the
egg-passage, and a spermatozoön
gains entrance
into the interior of the egg through the micropyle. In Œcanthus,
according to Ayers, fecundation probably takes place while the egg
is passing into the vagina, “since it is hardly possible that the
male element could gain access to the follicles before the chorion is
secreted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Lepidoptera, as has been stated, the copulatory pouch opens
separately from the opening of the oviduct (vagina), but a slender
canal connects the pouch with the vagina (Fig. 310, <i>bc</i>). The outlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>(“vagina” of Burgess) of the copulatory pouch opens between the
7th and 8th segments, that of the oviduct (vagina) on the 9th segment
being “situated immediately below the anus and hardly separated
from it, between the lappets of the
9th segment.” (Burgess.) The opening of
the copulatory pouch is, as we have seen, the
genuine or primitive sexual opening.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The spermatheca.</b>—This is a sac or pouch
for the reception and storage or preservation
of the semen. While in most of the
higher insects it opens into the dorsal wall
of the vagina (Fig. 472, <i>f</i>), in the cockroach,
locusts, and grasshoppers it opens into the
bursa; but in other European Orthoptera,
as in most insects, it lies upon the dorsal
wall of the vagina. (Berlese.) In the cockroach,
it is a short tube dilated at the end
and wound into a spiral of about one turn. “From the tube a
cœcal process is given off, which may correspond with the accessory
gland attached to the duct of the spermatheca in many insects (<i>e.g.</i>
Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and some Lepidoptera). The spermatheca
is filled during copulation, and is always found
to contain spermatozoa in the fertile female.
The spermatozoa are no doubt passed into the
genital pouch from time to time, and there
fertilize the eggs descending from the ovarian
tubes.” In Meloë the spermatheca is exceedingly
large. (Miall and Denny, pp. 170, 171.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The colleterial glands.</b>—We have already
briefly referred to these glands. Those of the
cockroaches form a number of long blind
tubes opening into the vagina. They furnish
the material for the egg-capsule or oötheca,
viz. chitin and large crystals of oxalate of
lime.</p>

<p class='c013'>In <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i> “these glands are glistening
white till the time of oviposition approaches, when
they assume a yellow tint, and the octahedral crystals
are seen imbedded in a viscid substance which fills their lumina. This
viscid substance is soluble in potassium hydrate, and is consequently not chitin.
When excreted to form the oötheca, it slowly hardens, deepens in color, and
becomes insoluble in potassium hydrate. Light has nothing to do with this
change, which is possibly produced by the oxygen in the air. It is the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>change which is undergone by the cuticula of the insect itself immediately after
ecdysis.” (Wheeler.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The vagina or uterus.</b>—This is simply the end of the common
oviduct, which, when dilated, is called the vagina, and, in the pupiparous
forms, the uterus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cockroach the vagina opens by a median vertical slit
situated in the 8th sternite, into the genital pouch or bursa, upon
the dorsal wall of which the orifice of the spermatheca is situated.
In the sheep-tick the oviduct is enlarged to form the so-called
uterus, which furnishes a milk-like secretion for the nourishment
of the larva during its intra-uterine life.</p>

<p class='c007'>In insects in general, the external opening of the vagina is simple,
the chitinous structures (valves) at the opening being adapted to
receive the male intromittent organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the eggs are to be deposited deep below the surface of the
earth, or in wood, or in wood-boring larvæ, or in the body of caterpillars,
etc., they are inserted by the ovipositor (see p. 167).</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Signs of copulation in insects.</i>—Leydig has collected, partly from his own
observations and partly from those of others, a number of cases in which female
insects bear traces of having had sexual union, in the form of tags or plates
attached to the body, and apparently formed from material secreted by the
male. Such probably is the “pouch” on the abdomen of <i>Parnassius apollo</i>,
and a somewhat similar structure in <i>Fulgora laternaria</i>, and such is the plate
which is found on the hinder part of the abdomen of <i>Dyticus latissimus</i> and
<i>D. marginalis</i>. Leydig compares these structures with the white plate in
<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>, and with the little white lid on the spider Argenna, and finds
analogues among vertebrates. (Arbeit. Zool. Zoot. Inst. Wurzburg, x, 1891,

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Insects as a rule arise from eggs which are laid in a great
variety of situations, those species which are viviparous being
exceedingly few in number compared with the class as a whole. It
is noteworthy that Leydig has found in the same Aphis, and even in
the same ovary, an
egg-tube producing
eggs, while a neighboring
tube was producing
viviparous
individuals.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a> The
viviparous species are
confined to certain
May-flies, the Aphidæ,
Diptera (Sarcophaga,
Tachinidæ,
Œstridæ, and Pupipara),
and to certain
Coleoptera (Stylopidæ
and some Staphylinidæ).</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of eggs laid varies from a very few, as in the Collembola
and in the Psocidæ, or 15 or even less in certain fossorial wasps,
and from 20 to 35 in some locusts to many thousands in the social
insects, the honey-bee laying by estimate over 1,000,000 eggs in the
course of her life. Dr. Sharp thinks that from 50 to 100 may perhaps
be taken as an average number for one female to produce. The eggs
of insects with a complete metamorphosis are said by Brauer to be
smaller in proportion to the parent than those laid by ametabolous
or heterometabolous insects. In this respect the insects are paralleled
by the birds, the highest forms laying smaller eggs than the
water birds, ostrich, Apteryx, etc.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The egg, or ovum, when laid is not always ripe or perfect, but, as
in those of ants, continues to grow after oviposition. Others are laid
some time after the embryo has begun
to form; and in the flesh-flies the larva
hatches before the egg is deposited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insects as a rule instinctively lay their
eggs near or upon objects destined to be
the food of the larva; those of caterpillars
on leaves, those of many flies on
meat or carrion, those of Copris and
other dung-beetles in dung, those of
aquatic insects in water, while many
oviposit in the earth or in plants (Fig.
482), or in the bodies of animals destined
to be the hosts of the parasitic larvæ.
As the eggs are preyed upon by mites and
other animals, the contrivances and modifications
of the mode of egg-laying, and
the situations in which they are placed, are almost endless. Many
insects lay their eggs in a mass, covered with a gummy substance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>or those laid in the water, as the eggs of dragon-flies, caddis-flies,
Chironomus (Fig. 484), etc., are enveloped by a jelly-like mass.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i>oötheca</i> of the cockroach (Fig. 485) is a solid, dense case, which,
after being carried about by the mother, can be left without harm in
the crevices of the floors of houses.
The oötheca of Mantis (Fig. 486) is
formed by a large mass of frothy
matter, which hardens and is attached
to stems of plants.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, the female “walking-stick”
(<i>Diapheromera femoratum</i>)
drops her eggs, says Riley, loosely upon
the ground, from whatever height she may happen to be, and “one hears a
constant pattering, not unlike drops of rain, that results from the abundant
dropping of these eggs, which, in places, lay so thick among and under the
dead leaves that they may be scraped up in great
quantities.” (Report for 1879.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The eggs of the lace-winged flies are supported
on pedicels, above the reach of ovivorous
mites.</p>

<p class='c013'>The female Chrysopa usually lays between 40 and 50
eggs. In one case, we observed that 18 egg-stalks were
deposited, but there were only nine well-formed eggs in
the batch, and nine eggless stalks, some only half the
usual height, others with the knob of cement at the
end to which the egg is ordinarily fastened. The eggs
are evidently stuck on to the end of the pedicel after the
latter has been formed, as, in one instance, an egg was
glued to the stalk very much out of centre, the insect’s
abdomen not having been aimed straight, so to speak, at
the mass of cement.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The eggs of Rhodites are fixed to a long stalk thickened
at the end; those of Inquilines and certain Chalcids
(<i>Leucospis gigas</i>, Fig. 489, <i>A</i>) are also stalked; and the
use of this stalk in the eggs of Cynips (<i>E</i>) is thought
by Adler to be respiratory, while, also, he states that
the egg-cavity
communicates
with
the egg-stalk,
so
that a part
of the egg-contents
can pass into the latter,
and this happens at the laying of
each egg. The egg of certain ichneumons
(Paniscus, Fig. 488) ends
in a short stalk, which is inserted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>in the skin of the caterpillar destined to serve as the host of the parasite, the
eggs, as stated by De Geer, being retained more firmly in the integument by
the stalk so swelling as to form two
knobs (Fig. 498, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>Certain Homoptera also have stalked
eggs, as those of <i>Psylla pyricola</i> (Fig.

<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), and of an allied form, <i>Aleurodicus

</div>

<p class='c013'>Reference should also be made to
the eggs of lice, which are oval and
attached to the hairs of their host. Those of the ox bot-fly (<i>Hypoderma lineata</i>)
are usually placed four to six together, and fastened to a hair. The lower portion
of the egg is admirably
adapted for clasping a
hair. “It consists of
two lobes, forming a
bulbous enlargement,
which is attached to
the egg by a broad, but
rather thin, neck, so
that, when the latter is
viewed sidewise, it appears
as a slender pedicel”
(Fig. 490, <i>a-d</i>).
(Riley in Insect Life,
iv, p. 307.) The egg of
another fly (<i>Drosophila ampelophila</i>, Fig. 491) bears a pair of long, slender appendages
near the anterior end. “The egg is inserted into the soft pulp of the
decaying fruit; these appendages leave the ovipositor last, and are spread out upon
the surface of the mass. They, in this way,
serve to keep the egg in place, and thus insure
the emergence of the larva into the open air
instead of into the more or less fluid mass in
which the egg is situated. The larva issues
from the egg just above the base of these appendages.”
(Comstock.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Mode of deposition.</b>—The

of oviposition has
been rarely observed,
or at least
not observed in detail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>and further observations are much needed. In the cockroach
(Phyllodromia), Wheeler has seen the eggs pass out of the oviduct
and become arranged in the oötheca, in a way similar to that in
the account published by Kadyi on Periplaneta.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When about to form the capsule, the female Blatta closes the genital armature,
and the two folds of the white membrane which lines the oöthecal cavity
close vertically in the middle line. Then some of the contents of the colleterial
glands are poured into the chamber, and bathe the inner surface of the posterior
wall. The first egg glides down the vagina from the left ovary, describes an
arc, still keeping its germarium-pole uppermost, after having pressed the
micropylar area against the mouth of the spermatheca, passes to the right
side of the back of the chamber, and is placed perpendicularly two-thirds to
the right of the longitudinal axis of the insect’s body. The next egg comes
from the right ovary, describes an arc to the opposite side of the body, decussating
with the path of the first egg, and is placed completely on the left side of the
median line. The third
egg comes from the left
ovary, and is made to
lie completely on the
right side of the median
line; and so the process
continues, the ovaries
discharging the eggs
alternately, and each
egg describing an arc to
the opposite side of the
capsule. The oöthecal
chamber soon becomes
too small to contain all
the constantly accumulating
eggs, so the anal
armature opens and allows
the end of the capsule
to project. A raised
line, the impression of
the edges of the white
membrane, runs down
the end of the capsule.
The last egg deposited
comes from the right
ovary, and lies two-thirds
on the left, and one-third
to the right, of the
median line. As soon
as the egg is laid, a
further discharge from
the colleterial glands spreads over the vaginal or anterior wall of the cavity,
and becomes evenly continuous with the secretion which has before been
spread over the back and the sides of the capsule by the white membrane.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The crista, a cord-like ridge running the full length of the dorsal surface of
the capsule, is a thick-walled tube, either half of which is formed by the edge
of the side walls of the capsule split into two laminæ. The rhythmical clasping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>of the three pairs of palpi which guard the vaginal opening is registered in an
exquisite pattern on the inner face of either half of the crista.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of oviposition in the locust has been fully described by
Riley, who states that the eggs pass down and out of the oviduct,
and “guided by a little finger-like style” (Fig. 298), they pass in
between the horny valves of the ovipositor, and issue at their tips
amid the mucous fluid which forms the egg-capsule (Fig. 492).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Vitality of eggs.</b>—It is well known that the eggs of phyllopod
and other fresh-water Crustacea have wonderful vitality, withstanding
extreme dryness for several years, at least from two to ten.
Such cases are unknown among insects. It has been observed, however,
by T. W. Brigham, and also by L. Trouvelot, that the eggs of
the walking-stick (<i>Diapheromera femorata</i>) for the most part hatch
only after the interval of two years.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The eggs of Bittacus are said by Brauer to lie over unhatched for
two years; indeed, the first condition of their hatching is a complete
drying of the earth in which the eggs lie, the second is a succeeding
thorough wetting of the ground in spring.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Appearance and structure of the ripe egg.</i>—The eggs of insects are
on the whole rather large in proportion to the size of the parent,
especially so in many minute forms, as the fleas, lice, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their general shape is spherical or oval, often cylindrical; where
the eggs are long and cylindrical a dorsal and ventral side can be
distinguished (Fig. 502). They are in the Tortricidæ and Limacodid
moths flattened, thin, and scale-like. In the eggs of locusts and
grasshoppers, as well as certain Diptera, the ventral side of the
embryo corresponds to the convex side, and the concave side of the
egg to the dorsal region of the embryo (Figs. 502 and 493).</p>

<p class='c007'>There is an anterior and posterior end or pole, the anterior end
being that which in the body of the parent lies towards her head, or
towards the upper or distal end of the ovarian tube. Towards this
end lies in the later stages of embryonic life the head-end of the
embryo, while the posterior end of the embryo is turned towards the
hinder pole of the egg (Figs. 493 and 520).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The egg-shell and yolk-membrane.</b>—The ripe egg is protected by
two membranes: 1, an inner or <i>vitelline membrane</i> or <i>oölemma</i> (<i>dh</i>)
(Fig. 500, <i>d</i>), produced in the egg by a hardening of the outer layer,
and 2, the outer or <i>chorion</i> (<i>c</i>), which is secreted by the cells of the
ovarian follicle. The latter is divided into two layers: an inner,
the <i>endochorion</i>, and an outer, the <i>exochorion</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While the yolk-membrane is usually a completely homogeneous,
thin, structureless membrane, the chorion or shell of the egg is
usually covered with a network of ridges enclosing polygonal areas,
varying in shape according
to the species or
genus. These external
markings are due to the
impress of the cellular
structure of the epithelium
of the ovarian
follicle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the chorion of the
cockroach the surface
appears to be finely
granular, the finest granules being arranged in large, more or less
regularly hexagonal areas, which are bounded by narrow, dark
spaces, containing somewhat larger though less dense granules. The
surface of the eggs of certain Phasmids are variously sculptured
(Fig. 494).</p>

<p class='c013'>The true structure of the chorion can only be, as Wheeler observes, seen in
cross-sections, as shown by Blochmann, and also by Wheeler. The chorion
consists of two chitinous laminæ kept in close apposition by means of numerous
minute trabeculæ or pillars. It is the ends of these pillars that look like granules.
In the spaces between the hexagonal areas, the trabeculæ are more
scattered and individually thicker than those of the hexagons.</p>

<p class='c007'>These markings are of singular beauty and complexity in the eggs
of many Lepidoptera, whose ova are variously ribbed, forming a
beautiful fretwork of raised lines (Figs. 495
and 496), while in the Diptera and Hymenoptera
the chorion is less solid, and
usually smooth under low
powers. The exochorion of the egg of the house and meat fly (<i>C.
vomitoria</i>) is pitted with elongated hexagonal depressions, which cross
the egg transversely. That of the honey-bee is also divided into
long hexagonal areas (Fig. 497).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the eggs are deposited in exposed places, and remain in
such situations for several days, or weeks, or even through the
winter, the shell is either solid and strengthened by the ribs and
ridges; or the shell, if of winter eggs, is unornamented, and is dense
and solid, to resist extremes in temperature or the attacks of egg-eating
birds, mites, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The micropyle.</b>—This is an opening or
canal, or, as in most insects, a group of
canals situated at the anterior end of
the egg for the entrance of the spermatozoa
during the process of fertilization
of the ovum (Fig. 498). In Acrydians,
however, the micropyle is situated
at the posterior end of the egg. The
micropyle (Fig. 499) is a complicated
apparatus within whose circumference
the vitelline membrane appears to be
firmly attached to the chorion, so that
the perforation passes through the chorion
as well as the yolk-membrane.</p>

<p class='c007'>The micropyles of the cockroach are
probably as simple and generalized as
in any insect. Wheeler states that they
are in Phyllodromia scattered over the
end of the egg, “over a quadrant of the
upper hemisphere, where the beautiful
hexagonal pattern of the chorion gives
away to an even trabeculation.” The
micropyles are wide-mouthed, very
oblique, funnel-shaped canals, perforating
the chorion, the apertures of the funnels
appearing under a low power as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>clear, oval spots, the long axis of which is parallel to the long
axis of the egg.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With a higher power the tube of each funnel is clearly visible as a thin
canal which dilates rapidly into the large oval aperture on the outer face of the
chorion. The narrow tube is sometimes fully as long as the large orifice. The
micropylar perforations are all directed from the germarium to the vaginal pole
of the egg. Hence a line, the hypothetical path of the spermatozoön, drawn
through one of these oblique micropyles, and continued into the egg, would
strike the equatorial plane. The female pronucleus, as we shall see further on,
moves in this plane.” (Wheeler, p. 289.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The micropylar region is generally, at least in Orthoptera and
Odonata, covered by a gelatinous cap (Figs. 499 and 500, <i>gs</i>), which
may form a covering membrane
which extends over a large part
of the egg, or may envelop the
entire outer surface. In some
cases micropyles are scattered
over the entire surface of the
egg, but usually the perforation
is situated at the end, and is
often guarded by raised processes,
either one or several, like
bristles, or toadstools, etc., these
being especially characteristic of
the eggs of certain Hemiptera (Nepa, Fig. 501, <i>a</i>, and Ranatra), or
the region is variously sculptured, as in the eggs of butterflies. In
the micropylar apparatus of Œcanthus the papillæ have a distinct
lumen (Fig. 499), or a channel for the ingress of the male filament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another use of the micropylar apparatus noticed by Ayers in the
egg of the tree-cricket is that it “serves as a thick, roughened plate,
against which the insect may push when ovipositing, without injury
to the egg, and without danger that the ovipositor slips from its
place.” In Chrysopa eggs the micropyle
forms a conspicuous button-like
knob, resembling the finely
milled head of a certain kind of
screw.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Internal structure of the egg.</b>—The
egg-contents are surrounded by
an outer layer of protoplasm or
formative yolk, which is separate
from the inner parts of the egg
(Fig. 502, <i>do</i>), the latter being
mostly composed of the nutritive
yolk-element. The superficial protoplasmic
layer, called by Weismann
<i>Keimhautblastem</i> (<i>K</i>) is, in
a few cases, afterwards entirely
lost, but in most instances forms a
very thin layer of clear protoplasm,
slight in extent compared with the
yolk-mass within.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eggs of insects are rich in
yolk, only certain eggs, such as those
of the Aphides and the egg parasites
(Proctotrypidæ) being poor in
yolk. The eggs of heterometabolous
insects have been said by
Brauer to contain relatively more
yolk than those of the Metabola,
particularly the Diptera; though,
as Wheeler observes, this rule has
some exceptions, the eggs of the
17–year Cicada being very numerous
and small.</p>

<p class='c013'>This he thinks is a greater advantage to the insect than the production of a
few large eggs, “when we consider the extremely long period of larval life and
the vicissitudes to which the larvæ may be subjected during all this time.”
“Similarly, <i>Meloë angusticollis</i> produces a large number of very small eggs,
while the eggs of the smaller beetles (Doryphora, <i>e.g.</i>) are much larger. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>Meloë is a parasitic form, and probably only a few of its many offspring ever
succeed in gaining access to the egg of the bee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the eggs of Chrysopa the yolk-granules are remarkably small,
so that the primitive band is in strong contrast to the yolk in color
and density. When crushed, the yolk does not flow out as a liquid,
but in a pasty mass, and we have questioned whether, as in the eggs
of Limulus, whose yolk is solid with fine granules, the denseness of
the yolk is not connected in the way of cause and effect with their
exposed situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The central or yolk-mass (Fig. 502, <i>do</i>) consists chiefly of rounded
masses of yolk, with fat-globules, between which extends a fine network
of protoplasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The elements of the yolk are spherical and strongly refractive, by
pressure becoming polygonal structureless homogeneous bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The germinal vesicle of the ripe insect-egg lies in the centre of the
yolk, where it appears as a large vesicle-like cell-nucleus containing
a few chromatin elements.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> Maturation or ripening of the egg</h4>

<p class='c016'>Before the eggs of animals can be fertilized, they require in some
observed cases, and probably in animals in general, to undergo a
series of changes, which, as observed in the starfish, etc., consists in
the replacement of the germinal vesicle by a very much smaller egg-nucleus,
and also at the same time the construction at one pole of the
egg of the directive or polar bodies (Fig. 502, <i>r</i>). Towards the end
of the ripening process of the insect egg this vesicle, according to
Blochmann, passes to the dorsal surface of the egg, and is transformed
into the directive spindles (<i>Richtungspindel</i>).</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Fertilization of the egg</h4>

<p class='c016'>The egg next requires the penetration and admission into the
yolk-interior of a spermatozoön.</p>

<p class='c007'>This process is essentially in insects, as in other animals, the
fusion of the sperm-nucleus with the nucleus of the egg. Under
normal conditions but a single spermatozoön is required for fertilization.
As shown by Hertwig, in the sea-urchin, after the spermatozoön
has penetrated into the egg, the head, and the small rounded
body, called a <i>centrosome</i>, can still be recognized, but the tail becomes
fused with the yolk of the egg. In the protoplasm of the egg (called
<i>cytoplasm</i>) the achromatic end of the sperm-nucleus gives rise to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>conspicuous rays, like those observed in ordinary cell-division. Preceded
by these rays, the sperm-nucleus or male pronucleus (Fig. 502, <i>p</i>)
moves towards the nucleus of the egg, and finally fuses with it, thus
forming a new single nucleus. This latter, which is called “the cleavage
nucleus,” rapidly forms a nuclear or “cleavage spindle” (Fig.
503). This act gives an impulse to the cleavage of the egg, which is
the first step in the formation of the embryo. All these changes
have yet to be worked out in detail in insects by microscopic sections
of the egg, whose generally hard and opaque egg-shells present
great obstacles to such work.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> Division and formation of the blastoderm<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c016'>In insects as in most other Arthropoda the segmentation of the
yolk is superficial and not total. The ovum is <i>centrolicithal</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
yolk is concentrated at the centre of the egg, and surrounded by a
peripheral layer of transparent protoplasm (the <i>Keimhautblastem</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first step in segmentation is the movement of the first division-nucleus
(<i>i.e.</i> that in the fertilized egg arising from the union of the

the egg in order to multiply itself by the mode of indirect nuclear
division (Figs. 504, <i>A</i>, and 507).</p>

<div class='nf-center c031'>
    <div>—After Korotneff.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The origin of numerous division-nuclei as the offspring of the first has been
observed to take place in the eggs of those insects (Aphides, Cecidomyia, and
Cynips) which have a slight amount of yolk. Yet in the large, ordinary eggs of
insects with an abundance of yolk there is no doubt, say Korschelt and Heider,
that these numerous division-nuclei, which soon after the process of oviposition
are scattered within the egg between the yolk-spheres, and are enveloped by a
star-shaped protoplasmic layer, and which constitute the formative elements
of the blastoderm,—there is no doubt but that they have practically arisen
through indirect nuclear division from the first division-nucleus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process of formation of the blastoderm in ordinary eggs with abundant
yolk was first observed by Bobretsky in the eggs of a moth (Porthesia) and
Pieris, also by Graber, and more recently by Blochmann in Musca, and by
Heider in Hydrophilus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the earliest stage observed by Bobretsky there first appear after fertilization
a few (the smallest number four) cell-like, minute amœboid masses of
protoplasm, each with a distinct nucleus. A few (one at least) of these bodies
gradually pass out of the centre of the yolk to the surface of the egg (Fig. 504,
<i>A</i>, <i>n</i>), these becoming larger and rounder, and from one or two of these nuclei
(<i>B</i>, <i>bc</i>) the blastoderm originates (<i>C</i>, <i>bl</i>). Those nuclei remaining in the yolk
increase in number and afterwards become the nuclei of rounded masses of yolk-granules,
forming the so-called yolk-spheres which Bobretsky regards as true cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the few blastoderm cells situated on the upper end of the egg are added
others which continue to pass from the yolk to the periphery, and then the
blastoderm spreads out farther and farther from the upper end of the egg until
finally it covers or envelops the whole yolk. This layer of cells is called the
<i>blastoderm</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the origin of the primitive amœboid cells, Bobretsky is in doubt, but is
disposed to think that they are the result of the subdivision of the germinative
vesicle or nucleus of the ovarian egg-cell. In this connection may be quoted the
observations of Graber, who states that an examination of the ovarian cell at an
early period has revealed the presence, in the centre of the yolk, of a number of
amœboid cells, which appear to have been formed by the division of the germinal
vesicle. These “primary embryonic cells” have a relatively large nucleus
and a number of nucleoli. Several may be seen to unite with one another by
means of their pseudopodia, and they may also be observed to undergo division.
With this account may be compared the results obtained by Korotneff in his
work on the embryology of the mole-cricket (Fig. 505).</p>

<div  class='figcenter id105'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The result of these and of later observations, especially those of
Blochmann on Musca, and those of Heider on Hydrophilus, show
that the division-nuclei lie near
the centre of the egg, along the
longitudinal axis (Fig. 507, <i>A</i>).
Each of these nuclei is enveloped
by a star-shaped mass of protoplasm,
and on the whole resembles
a wandering amœboid cell.
These isolated masses of protoplasm
are all connected by a fine
network of rays, which unite to
form within the yolk a syncytium.
Afterwards, in the later
stages, these division-cells, as
they may be, though somewhat
incorrectly, regarded, move
nearer the periphery and arrange
themselves into a plane parallel
with the surface (Figs. 506, <i>A</i>,
507, <i>B</i>). Continuing to divide,
they reach the surface and fuse
with the peripheral protoplasmic
layer (Figs. 506, <i>B</i>, 507, <i>C</i>).
Then follows the division into
single cell-territories (Figs. 506,
<i>B</i>, 507, <i>C</i>), corresponding to the
division-nuclei, through the appearance
of furrows which pass
in from the outer surfaces of the
egg into the interior and gradually
penetrate the entire “keimhautblastem.”
In this way the
surface of the egg is covered with
an epithelium (blastoderm). In
many insects the so-called inner
“keimhautblastem” (Fig. 506,
<i>D</i>, <i>i</i>) is formed by the separation
of a layer of protoplasm which
contains larger granules and are accumulated between the blastoderm
and the upper surface of the central nutritive yolk-mass. By
the addition of this plasmic layer the cells of the blastoderm increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>in height, and now form a cubical or cylinder epithelium, which

</div>

<p class='c016'>The embryo first arises as a whitish streak or band-like thickening
on the ventral side of the egg, and is variously called the “primitive
streak,” “primitive band,” “germinal band,” or “embryonal streak.”
In most cases the primitive band is divided at regular intervals by
transverse furrows, indicating the limits of what are to be the body
segments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cross-sections (Fig. 509) show that the band is composed of
several layers, <i>i.e.</i> an outer layer (ectoderm) and an inner layer
which comprises the endoderm and mesoderm, and so long as these
two layers are not sharply differentiated from one another, this
second layer may be called, with Kowalevsky, “the inner lower
layer, or ento-mesoderm” (Figs. 508, 509, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>u</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>It is characteristic of insects, only rarely occurring in other
arthropods (<i>e.g.</i> the scorpion), that the primitive streak is not situated
on the surface of the egg, but becomes overgrown by a folded
structure (Fig. 508, <i>af</i>) rising from its edges, the amnion-fold, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>that it appears somewhat depressed or sunken in under the upper
surface of the yolk. While the amnion-folds are extending from all
sides over the primitive band, there becomes formed under it, by the
invagination of the outer surface of the egg, a cavity, the amnion-cavity
(<i>ah</i>), which, when the amnion-fold has completely overgrown
the primitive band and united together (Fig. 509, <i>C</i>), appears completely
closed from without.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the embryonic membranes.</b>—The amnion-folds finally
completely overgrow the primitive band (Fig. 509, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>), and
form the embryonal membranes. The primitive band is seen after
its completion to be overgrown by a double cellular epithelial
membrane. The outer of these two membranes, that which arises
from the outer leaf or layer of the amnion-fold, is the <i>serosa</i> (Figs.
508, <i>B</i>; 509, <i>C</i>, <i>s</i>; 510). This passes continuously into the unchanged
part of the blastoderm, which has no part in the formation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>primitive band and germ-layers, and which covers the outer surface
of the yolk. Thus the <i>serosa</i>, which is usually held to include this
portion also of the blastoderm,
forms a closed sac which covers
the whole surface of the egg, with
one part extending over the surface
of the yolk, and the other over the
primitive band (Fig. 510).</p>

<p class='c007'>The inner of the two layers,
called the <i>amnion</i> (Fig. 509, <i>am</i>),
is more closely connected with the
embryo. The amnion and ectoderm
of the primitive band together
form a completely closed
sac, whose lumen forms the
amniotic cavity. Originally connected
with the serous membrane,
it splits off from the primitive
band about the time the appendages
begin to bud out, and continues
to closely envelop the body
and appendages, as seen in Fig.
509. Both of these membranes
are, before the time of hatching,
either absorbed, or, as in Lepidoptera,
retained. The amnion is
retained until after hatching in
the locust, etc. In certain Coleoptera
the serosa is retained, and the
amnion is absorbed (Fig. 532),
while in Chironomus and the
Trichoptera the serosa is absorbed,
and the amnion retained,
with the egg-shell or chorion.

<p class='c013'>In the embryo of Xiphidium and Orchelimum Wheeler has found and described
with much detail a membranous structure which he calls the <i>indusium</i>. “The
organ,” he says, “appears to have been retained by the Locustidæ, and completely
lost by the embryos of other winged insects.” It arises in Xiphidium,
as a simple circular thickening of the blastoderm, between and a little in front
of the procephalic lobes (Figs. 511, 512, <i>A-E</i>), and afterwards spreads over nearly
the whole surface of the egg, leaving the poles uncovered, as in Fig. 513, where it is
divided into two further membranes, the inner and outer indusium, the former
lying in contact with the amnion. After this the serosa “is excluded from
taking any part in the development of the embryo; both its position and function
are now usurped by the inner indusium.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>Hence in an egg of the Locustidæ Wheeler distinguishes, passing from within
outward in a median transverse section of the egg, the following envelopes:</p>

  <dl class='dl_4'>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>1. The chorion. 2. The blastoderm-skin-like cuticle secreted by the serosa. 3. The 
    serosa. 4. The outer indusium. 5. A layer of dark granular secretion (probably some 
    urate). 6. The cuticle secreted by the inner indusium. 7. The inner indusium. 8. The 
    amnion. While envelopes 1–7 invest the whole egg; layer 8, the amnion, covers only the 
    embryo.

</div>

<p class='c013'>Wheeler further suggests that the so-called micropyle of the Collembola
(Anurida), which has been homologized with the “dorsal organ” of Crustacea,
is a possible homologue of the indusium, as also the “primitive cumulus” of
spiders, and the “facette” or “cervical cross” of Pentastomids described by
Leuckart and also by Stiles.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The gastrula stage.</b>—The primitive band invaginates so as to give
the opportunity for the formation of the inner layer. This invagination,
which at a certain stage is established along the whole
length of the primitive band, forms a median furrow and may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>regarded as the gastrula-invagination of insects. The lower (inner)
layer thus arising afterwards spreads out under the entire primitive
band (Fig. 509, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>), the edges of which become bordered
by the growing amnion-fold. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In certain forms the primitive band arises from several separate rudiments
which afterwards unite. Thus in Musca and Hydrophilus the anterior and posterior
ends develop first, and in Hydrophilus the procephalic lobes originate
independently of the rest of the band. In the Aphides, also, according to Will,
these lobes arise independently, afterwards uniting with the primitive band.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Division of the embryo or primitive band into body-segments.</b>—Meanwhile
the primitive band grows at the expense of the yolk, spreading
out more and more over its surface, until in certain cases
(Coleoptera, Diptera, Siphonaptera, and Trichoptera) it lies like a
broad ribbon over the yolk, so that the two ends nearly meet on the
dorsal side. By this time it becomes divided by transversely impressed
lines into segments, which correspond to those of the larva
and adult. The first of these segments is divided into two broad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>and flaring flaps, which are called the procephalic lobes. It
becomes the antennal segment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preceding account of the relations of the
primitive band to the yolk does not apply to all
insects, since there are variations which appear
to depend on the form of the egg, and on the
amount and distribution of the yolk-masses. In
certain Coleoptera, the primitive band sinks down
and thus becomes immersed into the yolk. In
Donacia (Kölliker and Melnikow) and Hydrophilus
(Heider), and in the Chrysomelidæ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>Attelabus, a weevil, as we have observed, the primitive band rests on the
outside of the yolk, but in <i>Telephorus fraxini</i> it is immersed. In the Hemiptera
it is immersed (Fig. 516), but there is much variation in this respect, the degree
of immersion being most marked in the Coccidæ (Aspidiotus), and least so in
Corixa. Besides the position of the primitive band,
there are in Odonata and Hemiptera differences in
the origin of the primitive band itself and of the
embryonic membranes.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Korschelt and Heider divide the early embryo of
insects into two types:</p>

<p class='c013'>1. Into those with a superficial primitive band;
viz., where there is no passage of yolk-elements into
the space between the amnion and serosa. The
primitive band has in such cases a relatively superficial
position (Figs. 508, 509, 521, 535). Examples
are certain Orthoptera (Blatta, Œcanthus, Mantis,
Gryllotalpa), also certain Hemiptera (Corixa), certain
Coleoptera, and the Trichoptera, Diptera, and
Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. Into those with an immersed primitive band,
with the space between the serosa and amnion
filled with yolk (Figs. 517, 518, 534). Examples
are the orthopterous Stenobothrus, Odonata, many
Hemiptera (the Pediculina and Pyrrhocoris), the
Coleoptera already mentioned, and Lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>It should be observed, however, that these differences
are of little phylogenetic or taxonomic value,
since genera of the same order, notably the Coleoptera,
differ as to the position of the primitive band,
so also two orders so nearly allied as the Trichoptera
and Lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Differences between the invaginated and overgrown primitive band.</b>—In
respect to the mode of origin of the primitive band and its relative position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>there are two opposite types, though connected by transitional forms. In
the one case the primitive band, <i>i.e.</i> its ventral portion, the “ventral plate”
(Fig. 518, <i>b</i>, <i>p</i>) is pushed in or invaginated in the interior of the egg; in the
other case it becomes overgrown by the folds of the amnion arising from its
edges.</p>

<p class='c013'>In insects with an overgrown primitive band, the band at the beginning is

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In insects with an invaginated
primitive band, of which
the Odonata afford examples,
the first rudiment of the
primitive band is in the form
of a ventral plate of slight
extent passing ventrally in
the hinder half of the egg, in
whose posterior section a process
of invagination (Fig. 518,
<i>A</i>, <i>kh</i>), soon occurs. The
cavity of this invagination is
the first indication of the
amnion-cavity (Fig. 518, <i>B</i>,
<i>ah</i>), while its wall in its
thickened ventral part (<i>K′</i>) is
concerned in the formation of
the primitive band, and, in its
dorsal thin part, in the formation
of the amnion (<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>am</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'><b>Revolution of the embryo
where the primitive band is
invaginated.</b>—At first the
head-end of the embryo is
directed towards the posterior
end of the egg, as in dragon-flies
(Fig. 518). Also that
surface of the primitive band
which afterwards faces the
ventral, is at first turned
towards the dorsal side of the
egg. In order to bring the
primitive band into the later
relations, there must occur
the process of revolution, or
turning, of the embryo. The
somewhat advanced embryo
of the Odonata, after the appearance
of the head and
thoracic appendages, undergoes
a rotating motion around
its transverse axis, and at the
same time turns out of the
amniotic cavity (Fig. 520, <i>B</i>).
This process is so managed
that near the head-region, the
amnion and serosa, there
closely situated to each other,
are fused together, and at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>place tear or burst open. Through this rent (<i>a</i>), in the same place in which
the original invagination-opening was situated, the amniotic cavity again opens,
and through the opening thus formed first the head and then the succeeding
segments of the primitive band (Fig. 520, <i>B</i>) pass out, and remain there while
the head passes on to the anterior pole of the egg on the ventral side, the embryo
thus assuming a position like that of other insects. (Kowalevsky.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In the parasitic Hemiptera (Pediculina), according to Melnikow, the opening
in the membranes near the head remains permanent, and the embryo becomes
everted through it, while the yolk, enclosed in the continuous membrane formed
by the amnion and serous membrane, forms a yolk-sac on the dorsal surface.
The same process occurs in Mallophaga, and also in Œcanthus, as described by
Ayers (Fig. 521). Generally as soon as the embryo passes out of the amniotic
cavity the latter soon becomes smaller and finally completely disappears.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As the embryo grows, and the sides grow up and the back closes over, the
contents of the yolk-sac are soon taken up and absorbed in the intestinal cavity,
which communicates with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Phyllodromia, according to Wheeler, the process of revolution is “hurried
through by the embryo from the beginning of the 16th to the end of the 17th
day.” Several successive stages are represented in Fig. 522. In the 15th day
the embryo still occupies the middle of the ventral surface of the egg. Soon the
envelopes (amnion and serosa, <i>as</i>) rupture, an irregular slit being formed, and
soon the egg and embryo are as seen in Fig. 522, <i>B</i>, the embryo standing out free
from its envelopes on the yolk, and the edges of its dorsal growing walls (<i>b</i>) are
distinctly marked. The tail now lies at the caudal end of the egg (Fig. 522, <i>C</i>).
By the 17th day the walls have closed in the median dorsal line, and the embryo
has grown in length to such an extent as to bring its head to the cephalic
pole (Fig. 522, <i>E</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>Korschelt and Heider consider, since the primitive band of the chilopod myriopods
(Geophilus) is curved in at the middle and sinks into the interior of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>yolk, that in insects the invaginated primitive band is the ancestral or primitive
one, the overgrown primitive band being derived from it. The overgrown
primitive band by its position may also be better insured against certain mechanical
attacks, perhaps also against the danger of drying up.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>f.</i> Formation of the external form of the body</h4>

<p class='c016'><b>Origin of the body-segments.</b>—As we have seen, the first traces of
segments appear very early, the primitive band being divided
by superficial transverse furrows into segments. This segmentation
into arthromeres (somites or metameres) can be observed in
Hydrophilus and Chalicodoma at a time when gastrulation begins
(Figs. 515, 536). The segmentation extends not only across the
median portion of the primitive band, through whose invagination
the inner layer (endomesoderm) results, but also to the lateral portions
which become a part of the ectoderm of the primitive band.
These transverse furrows correspond to thinner places in the epithelium,
which in this stage forms the embryonal rudiment. It thus
happens that, in the forms named, after the end of gastrulation not
only the ectoderm, but also the endomesoderm, is already segmented.</p>

<p class='c013'>So early an appearance of segmentation as that observed in Hydrophilus and
Chalicodoma we must regard as a falsification of the process of development
due to heterochrony. We must consider the conditions observed in other forms
as the primitive ones, in which (as, for example, in Lina and in Stenobothrus,
according to Graber) the gastrulation and separation of the ectoderm occurs in
the still unsegmented primitive band, the division into segments occurring in
later stages (Fig. 524). In these forms, then, the segmentation affects the
invaginated endomesoderm, as well as the ectoderm. (Korschelt and Heider,
p. 789.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the completely segmented primitive band may be distinguished
two regions of a peculiar appearance (Figs. 515, 527), one at the
anterior, and the other at the hinder end. The anterior, the primary
head-section, contains the mouth-opening, and is characterized
by its lateral expansions, or procephalic lobes. The other section,
or posterior section, the so-called anal segment or telson, contains
the anus. Between the two sections lies the segmented primary
trunk-segment, which in insects consists of 17 segments. Of these
the three most anterior are those destined to bear the mandibles and
two pairs of maxillæ; the three following are the thoracic, which
are succeeded by 10 abdominal segments, besides the 11th or telson
(pygidium, or suranal plate).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>It is now generally believed that there are primarily eleven abdominal segments,
while Heymons has detected twelve in the embryos of Blattids and
Forficula (see p. 162). In the later stages of embryonic development the number
of abdominal segments is diminished, the 10th and 11th abdominal segments
becoming fused. In Hydrophilus and Lina this is the case, but according to
Graber, in the Lepidoptera there is a fusion of the 9th and 10th abdominal segments,
the llth remaining free.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to Wheeler, in Doryphora, and also in Chalicodoma (Carrière),
between the primary head-region and the mandibular segment is interpolated a
rudimentary and transitory body-segment, the premandibular segment. According
to Carrière this segment corresponds to a rudimentary pair of limbs,
and also to a ganglion, which participates in the formation of the œsophageal
commissure (see p. 51).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The procephalic lobes.</b>—The head-lobes, or procephalic lobes, appear
at a very early period (Fig. 524, <i>kl</i>), before any traces of the
segments of the trunk region. Ayers has shown that in Œcanthus
the primitive band, in its earliest condition and before the appearance
of the head-lobes, is a simple oval plate or almond-shaped
thickening near the posterior end of the egg (Fig. 525, <span class='small'>1</span>, <span class='small'>2</span>). This
plate is “soon divided into two tolerably well-marked regions by
the enlargement of the head-end,” the first indication of the head-lobes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>(<span class='small'>3</span>). A depression next forms in what is to be the middle of
the forehead. “It indicates the position of the future labrum, and
forms the inner boundaries of the two cephalic ganglia, which are
developed on either side of this depression at a much later stage.”
Almost simultaneously with the appearance of this depression, two
lateral folds are formed in the trunk portion of the band, which are
the first indications of the maxillary and thoracic regions, the
abdominal portion not yet showing traces of a division into segments
(Fig. 525, <span class='small'>5</span>). The thickened outer edges of the head-fold
next gradually grow in towards the median line (Fig. 525, <span class='small'>5</span>),
and bend forward towards the region of the future mouth.
The rounded angle made by the posterior end of the head-fold is
the first indication of the antennæ. The embryo is now composed
of four well-marked regions: cephalic, maxillary, thoracic, and
abdominal. The primitive band then grows much longer, the
primitive mouth and anus appear, and the appendages bud out,
and eventually the embryo revolves and appears on the ventral side
of the egg (Fig. 525, <span class='small'>6</span>).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>These primitive regions of the primitive band, before the segments are formed,
are called by Graber <i>macrosomites</i>, and the secondary segments into which
they divide (which afterwards become the body-segments), <i>microsomites</i>. The
macrosomites are peculiar to insects, and may be an inheritance from a hypothetical
ancestral form. With Korschelt and Heider, we should hardly share
this view.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Our observations on locusts show clearly (1) that the procephalic
lobes are the pleural portion of the first cephalic or antennal segment;
(2) that the antenna is an appendage or
outgrowth of the procephalic lobes; (3) that
the eyes are a specialized group of epidermal
cells of the upper part of the procephalic lobes,
and are not homologues of the antennæ or of the
appendages in general; and (4) it seems to follow
from a study of the relations and mode of
development of the clypeus and labrum, that
they arise between the procephalic lobes, and
probably represent the tergal part of the
antennal segment, forming the roof of the
mouth, <i>i.e.</i> closing in from above the pharynx.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general the formation of the body-segments
into the primitive band is in succession from
before to the hinder end. This successive
appearance has been observed by Graber in
genera of different orders (Stenobothrus, Lina,
and Hylotoma). For example, in the beetle
Lina, after the appearance of the mandibular
and two maxillary segments, appear the three
thoracic segments, together with the two anterior
abdominal segments, the other abdominal
segments arising afterwards. In other cases,
the formation of segments seems to be simultaneous
along the entire length of the primitive
band. An exception to the rule has been
noticed by Heider in Hydrophilus, as in this
beetle the development of the segments of the
middle region appears somewhat delayed, while
the fore and hind parts of the primitive band
are more rapid in development. In Pieris, according to Graber,
the thoracic segments are more rapidly developed than the others;
soon after, the gnathic segments (mandibles and two pairs of
maxillæ) appear, and finally the abdominal segments are formed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span><b>Fore-intestine (stomodæum) and hind-intestine (proctodæum), Labrum.</b>—The
digestive canal of insects consists, as in other animals,
of three portions, the fore, mid, and hind gut or intestine.
The next change after the completion of the segments of the
primitive band is the development of the fore and hind intestine
and the appendages. The fore-intestine (stomodæum) arises as an
invagination in the area of the primary head-section, and the hind-intestine
(proctodæum) in the terminal section (Figs. 300 and 546).</p>

<p class='c013'>In insects generally the formation of the fore-intestine occurs earlier than
that of the hind-intestine. An exception was discovered by Graber and also
by Voeltzkow in Muscidæ, where the proctodæum appears earlier.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Usually at the time of origin of the stomodæum a projection
arises at the anterior edge of the primary head-region, the so-called
forehead (Fig. 527, <i>vk</i>),
which is the common rudiment
of the clypeus and
labrum. In many cases
(certain Coleoptera and
Lepidoptera) these rudiments
first assume the
form of paired hooks (see
Figs. 83, 102, 104, 105, of
Graber’s Keimstreif der
Insekten, also Figs. 529
and 546), which afterwards,
by fusion in the
median line, become
single, though notched in
the middle; but in the
more generalized Blatta
and Mantis, as well as in
bees, the rudiment is single
at the outset.</p>

<p class='c013'>The view advanced by Patten,
and also by Carrière, that the
labrum is a first pair of antennæ,
is scarcely tenable, and we quite agree with Korschelt and Heider in regarding
the clypeo-labral region as homologous with the upper lip of Crustacea,
and, we may add, of Merostomes and of Trilobites.</p>

<p class='c013'>It should be observed that in many insects, in their earlier embryonic state,
directly behind the mouth arises, from paired rudiments, what seem provisional
lower lip structures (not to be confounded with the 2d maxillæ of insects). This
under lip structure was first discovered by Bütschli in the bee (his inner or 2d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>antennæ), and afterwards by Tichomiroff in Lepidoptera. Heider, in his work
on Hydrophilus, describes it as the “lateral mouth-lips,” while, more recently,
Nusbaum has observed it in Meloë. This under lip structure may be regarded
as analogous to the paragnaths of Crustacea, although to attempt to homologize
it with these seems useless. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Completion of the head.</b>—Sufficient attention has not been paid to
this subject by embryologists. The head is at first, dorsally, mostly
composed of the head-lobes, or antennal segment only, and the
dorsal or tergal portion of the oral appendages develop at a later
period. We have observed in the embryo of dragon-flies (Æschna)
that the tergites of the mandibles and first maxillæ are simultaneously
fused with the head-lobes, while the much larger tergal
region of the 2d maxillæ remains for some time separate from the
anterior part of the head, and is continuous with the thoracic segments,
and it is only just before hatching that this segment becomes
fused with the rest of the head (Fig. 36). In a sense, the 2d
maxillary segment when it is free from the head reminds us of the
foot-jaw, or 5th segment of chilopod myriopods (see also p. 53).</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>g.</i> The appendages</h4>

<p class='c016'>As we have seen, nearly or quite simultaneously all the limbs
as a rule bud out from each side of the median line of the primitive
band. They arise as saccular evaginations or outgrowths of the
ectoderm, directed a little backwards. They are at first filled with
mesoderm cells, and in the Orthoptera diverticula of the cœlom-sac
are taken up into the rudimental limbs, as in Peripatus and
Myriopoda. (Graber, Cholodkowsky.) As the antennæ, mouth-parts,
legs, and abdominal appendages are all alike at first, their
strict homology with one another is thus demonstrated. In insects
never more than a single pair of limbs is known to arise from one
segment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The cephalic appendages.</b>—The antennæ evidently arise from the
hinder edge of the procephalic lobes (Fig. 527, <i>an</i>). As in Limulus,
the first pair of appendages are at first postoral (Fig. 528, <i>at</i>),
afterwards moving forward owing to changes in the relative proportions
of the parts of the head, and they are in all respects, in their
development and position in relation to the segment from which
they arise, homologous with the appendages succeeding them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The occurrence of rudiments of a pair of preantennal appendages in Chalicodoma
which is claimed by Carrière, needs confirmation, as other embryologists
have not observed them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>The postoral appendages of the head are the mandibles and the
1st and 2d maxillæ, besides the supposed premandibular segment
already referred to on pp. 50–54, which only temporarily exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trophi or oral appendages are all alike at first, but soon differ
in shape, acquiring their characteristic form shortly before the
embryo leaves the egg. The mandibles of Œcanthus are said by
Ayers at the time of revolution of the embryo to be slightly bilobed,
and in his Fig. 5, Pl. 19, they are represented as deeply trilobed,
but in general they are undivided. The 1st maxillæ are at this
time distinctly trilobed. The 2d maxillæ are separate, and distinctly
though unequally bilobed, becoming united shortly before
birth. In the embryos of dragon-flies they are at an early date
very large and long, and directed backwards, and are not fused
together until just before hatching, when the extraordinary mask-shaped
labium is fully developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distal parts of the labium, such as the ligula, palpifer, and
palpus are elaborated before the mentum and submentum. Many
details as to the final changes in the mouth-parts before hatching
remain to be worked out.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span><b>The thoracic appendages.</b>—The three pairs of legs arise at the same
period and in the same manner in all insects; it is not until the end
of embryonic life that they become jointed, and that the claws and
onychia are developed. Especial attention has not yet been given to
the details of the development of the parts of the last joint of the
tarsus.</p>

<p class='c013'>In many forms the antennæ are the first to appear, the mandibles, maxillæ,
and legs appearing at a latter date, though simultaneously. It is thus in Stenobothrus,
Hydrophilus, and Melolontha. In Lina, according to Graber, the mandibles
precede the antennæ in appearance. In the Libellulidæ, according to
Brandt, the legs first appear, then the jaws, and lastly the antennæ. This did
not seem to be the case in the embryos of Æschna observed by us, although our
observations were more superficial.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, in those insects whose larvæ are footless, the rudiments
of the legs are retarded and aborted just before hatching (fossorial Hymenoptera
and Apidæ), or the rudiments of the legs are not developed at all.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The abdominal appendages.</b>—These appear soon after the thoracic
limbs, corresponding in most cases to the latter in shape and position,
and their position in the embryo is a matter of the greatest
interest. Von Rathke was the first embryologist to detect those of
the first abdominal segment, in his examination of the development
of Gryllotalpa. Long afterwards Bütschli detected them in the
embryo of the honey-bee, observing a pair on each segment. Patten
observed them in Trichoptera; Kowalevsky first perceived them in
Lepidoptera, Tichomiroff confirming his observations. Graber,
Ayers, and Wheeler have observed them in Orthoptera and Coleoptera,
and the latter has detected them also in Hemiptera and
Neuroptera; and while they do not arise in the embryos of Diptera
and of Siphonaptera, they are to be looked for in any or all the
lower or more generalized orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the result of these discoveries of polypodous embryos occurring
in all but the most specialized order (Diptera), it appears to be a
rational deduction that the winged insects have descended from
insects in which there were functional legs on each abdominal segment.
Such an ancestor was the forerunner of the Thysanura, in
which abdominal locomotive appendages still survive, though in a
modified, more or less aborted condition. This polypodous ancestral
form was apparently allied to Scolopendrella, which has a pair of
functional legs on each abdominal segment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The subject, then, of polypodous embryo insects is one of special interest,
and has attracted much attention from Graber, Wheeler, Haase, and others.
That these are genuine, though transitory appendages, is shown by the fact that
certain pairs persist throughout adult life. The embryology of the Thysanura
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>when worked out will throw much light on this subject, but we know that the
spring (elater) of Collembola (and possibly the collophore) and the cerci of the
winged insects are survivals of these limbs. That the three pairs of appendages
forming the ovipositor, or sting, are most probably derived from these appendages
is claimed by Wheeler (p. 167), and seems proved by the fact that Ganin and
also Bugnion has detected three pairs of imaginal disks in the embryo of parasitic
Hymenoptera. Hence the abdominal appendages may ultimately be found
to arise in nearly all cases from imaginal disks like those giving origin to the
cephalic and thoracic appendages.</p>

<p class='c013'>As regards the Diptera, Pratt has observed that each of the three thoracic and
eight abdominal segments of the embryo brachycerous Diptera (seen especially
well in Melophagus) has two pairs of imaginal disks, a dorsal and a ventral pair.
He thinks there is no doubt but that the ventral abdominal disks are homologous
with the rudimentary appendages which appear in the embryos of all other
insects, though not in the brachycerous dipters.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Appendages of the first abdominal segment (pleuropodia).</b>—As early
as 1844 Rathke observed in the embryo of the mole-cricket a pair
of appendages on the 1st abdominal segment, which he described
as mushroom-shaped bodies, and supposed to be embryonic gills.
They are called <i>pleuropodia</i> by Wheeler, who, with Patten, Graber,
and Nusbaum, ascribes a glandular function to them, while Wheeler
suggests that they were odoriferous repugnatorial organs. In Blatta
(Phyllodromia) they are of large size, in Melolontha enormous (Fig.
528, <i>B</i>) and filled with blood. Wheeler distinguishes as varieties,
beside the mushroom-shaped appendages of Gryllotalpa and Hydrophilus,
the reniform (Œcanthus), the broadly pyriform (Blatta), and
the elongate pyriform (<i>Mantis carolina</i>). In the European Mantis
they are most limb-like, with a digitiform continuation divided by
a constriction into two sections. (Graber.) In Meloë they assume
the shape of a stalked cup. (Nusbaum.) In the bee and in Lepidoptera
the pleuropodia are not present, though the temporary
appendages on the succeeding segments appear; Carrière, however,
found them on the two first abdominal segments of very young larvæ
of the wall-bee (Chalicodoma).</p>

<p class='c007'>Their cellular structure is peculiar, and they are either formed
by evagination or invagination, those of the latter type being subspherical
and solid. Those of the former type have a cavity communicating
by means of a narrow duct through the peduncle with
the body-cavity (Blatta). No tracheæ, nerves, or muscles enter
them, though blood-corpuscles have been seen in the cavities. “In
some species the pleuropodia produce a secretion from the ends of
their enlarged cells. This secretion may be a glairy albuminoid
substance (Cicada, Meloë), a granular mass (Stenobothrus), a bundle
of threads (Zaitha), or a thick, striated, cuticula-like mass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>(Acilius).” They attain their greatest size during the revolution of
the embryo, and they are “mere rudiments of what were probably in
remote ages much larger and more complex organs.” (Wheeler.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Lameere has observed that in Phyllodromia the first pair of abdominal appendages,
after becoming of considerable size, undergo an enlargement at their free
end, become detached, and fall into the amnion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wheeler also calls attention to the homology of these pleuropodia with the 1st
abdominal appendages of Campodea, shown by Haase to be originally glandular,
but with at present a respiratory function. In the embryos of later, higher
orders of insects, these appendages are in size and shape similar to those of the
succeeding segments. (See also p. 164.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Are the abdominal legs of larval Lepidoptera and phytophagous Hymenoptera
true limbs?</b>—The presence of these abdominal legs in the
embryos of Sphinx (Kowalevsky), of <i>Bombyx mori</i> (Tichomiroff), and
both <i>Bombyx mori</i> and <i>Gastropacha quercifolia</i> (except those of the
first segment), as well as in Hylotoma, which has 11 pairs of such
appendages, has suggested that the prop or prolegs of caterpillars
and saw-fly larvæ are survivals of these outgrowths, and not secondary,
adaptive structures. Opinions on this point vary. Balfour, and
also, more recently, Cholodkowsky, hold that the prolegs are survivals
of the embryonic appendages. Graber cautiously, after a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>lengthy and interesting discussion, says that the question cannot
be, in the present state of our knowledge, solved. He, however,
seems inclined to believe that the prolegs are not merely secondary
structures, and that the rudiments of limbs may remain for a long
time in a latent state before their final development. Korschelt
and Heider are disposed to regard the abdominal appendages of
Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera as true limbs, referring to Balfour’s
statement that in the Crustacea there are different examples of the
loss and later appearance of limbs, such as the loss of the mandibular
palpi of the zoëa of decapods, and the loss in the zoëa of
appendages in the Erichthus form of the Squilla larva corresponding
to the third pair of maxillipedes and first two pairs of legs of
Decapoda, and which are afterwards reproduced; similar cases
occurring in the Acarina. In the wasps and bees also, as is well
known, the imaginal disks of the thoracic appendages appear, the
legs themselves being suppressed in the larva (the imaginal disk
probably existing in an indifferent state), to reappear in the pupa
and imago. It does not, however, necessarily follow that the numerous
pairs of hooked ventral tubercles of certain dipterous larvæ
(Ephydra) are true appendages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to us that it is a strong argument for the view that these
prolegs are survivals of primitive limbs, that from similar embryonic
paired outgrowths on different segments arise the spring of Podurans,
the anal cerci, and three pairs of appendages forming the
ovipositor, and the anal legs of the Corydalus larva, as well as those
of caddis-worms; at least five abdominal segments throughout
the class of insects as a whole bearing appendages in the adult.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand the view of Haase, that the prolegs of caterpillars
are secondary, adaptive characters, is supported by the fact
of the rapidity with which two pairs on the 3d and 4th segments
nearly disappear in the larvæ of certain Noctuidæ (Catocala, etc.),
a reduction evidently due to disuse.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The tracheæ.</b>—The tracheal system arises as ectodermal invaginations
on one side of the appendages, appearing soon after the latter.
The earliest condition of the tracheal invagination is seen in section
at Fig. 539, <i>E</i>, <i>tr</i>; as it deepens, it sends off diverticula or tracheal
branches, while the narrow mouth of the invagination forms the
stigma. The cup-like cavities situated serially one behind the other,
and arising from the single tracheal invaginations, become at the
end or bottom of the cup elongated along the length of the body and
fused together at their ends; then the two longitudinal stems of
the system arise, by a breaking through at the place where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>original invagination had become fused, thus forming a continuous
tube, the lumina opening into each other. (Bütschli.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The cuticular tracheal intima is differentiated late in embryonic
life. The entrance of the air is accomplished in part before the
embryo hatches, the air being derived from the tissues and fluids of
the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>The farther development of the tracheal branches is due to the progressive
formation of diverticula. The branches thus arising are intercellular formations.
On the other hand, the finest twigs are intercellular structures. However, as
Schaeffer states, the differences between the two modes of formation are not
important.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wheeler mentions the existence of “two pairs of very indistinct tracheal
openings in the 10th and 11th somites” of the abdomen of Doryphora (Fig. 546,
<i>t<sub>19</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>20</sub></i>), and Heider believes that they exist in Hydrophilus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tracheal invaginations as a rule begin to appear after the
appendages commence to bud out. An exception is met with in the
bee (Apis), where the tracheal ingrowths are seen before the rudiments
of the legs. Most of the tracheal invaginations appear
simultaneously. Only rarely do we see an indication of their successive
development from before backwards. Thus in Hydrophilus,
Graber observed that the mesothoracic stigmata appeared somewhat
earlier than those of the other segments.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>h.</i> Nervous system</h4>

<p class='c016'>The rudiments of the nervous and tracheal systems essentially contribute
to the building up of the relief of the primitive band of
insects. The nervous system is the earliest to appear, being indicated
very early, in fact before the appendages begin to grow out.
The first traces of the nervous system are two ridges extending
along the primitive band, the depression between them being called
the primitive furrow. At an early period the segmentation is
observed in the primitive ridges, while widened spaces (the rudiments
of the ventral ganglia) alternate segmentally with the narrow
places which are the incipient longitudinal commissures (Fig.
527, <i>A</i>, <i>g</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The primitive ridges extend anteriorly into the head-lobes; this
part must be regarded as the rudiment of the œsophageal commissure.
The rudiments of the brain are from their first appearance
directly connected with the ventral chain of ganglia.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span><b>Completion of the definite form of the body.</b>—This is accomplished
by the growth of the primitive band around the yolk, the band
widening, so that its edges behind the head extend up, and finally
meet on the back, forming the back or tergum of the embryo, thus
enclosing the yolk (Fig. 530, <i>F</i>). The tergal wall of the head is
due to the dorsal growth of the head-lobes, and of the clypeo-labral
region. In the course of this process the anterior end of the primitive
band becomes turned up dorsally, forming a dorsal curve or
bend. By this bending up of the primitive band the forehead nearest
the mouth forms a transverse ridge, the labrum, while the basal
or earlier part of the forehead now is differentiated into the clypeus.
This clypeo-labral region likewise forms the roof or palatal region
of the mouth. The head-lobes cause by this dorsal growth a rotating
motion which carries the rudimental antennæ back over the
mouth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>In most other Arthropoda (Crustacea, Arachnida, Myriopoda, etc.)
development goes on by the formation of a so-called primitive band,
but without the appearance of peculiar
embryonic membranes. The outer surface
of the entire egg becomes, then, in part
covered by the band-like embryonic germ,
and partly by a portion of the blastoderm
which remains unchanged. The dorsal
region is formed by the widening and
spreading of the primitive band over the
greater part of the surface of the egg,
while the area of the unchanged section
of the blastoderm continually becomes
more restricted. It is generally accepted
that the latter is concerned in the dorsal
closure, because, together with a histological
transformation, it becomes involved
in the formation of the ectoderm
of the primitive band.</p>

<p class='c013'>A similar form of retrograde structure possibly
occurs in the embryos of Poduridæ, in which
a dorsal organ has been observed to develop in
an early embryonic stage, which bears some
relation to the cuticula enveloping the embryo, but whose significance is in
general rather obscure.</p>

<p class='c013'>In most insects the relations are more complicated, since in such cases, the
amnion-folds rise on the edges of the primitive band and of the unchanged section
of the blastoderm, whose retrograde development is intimately connected
with the closure of the back.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very simple case of dorsal closure, but which certainly is not a primitive
one, occurs in Muscidæ and certain other Diptera whose amnion-folds are developed
in a rudimentary way. In this case (according to Kowalevsky and
Graber), the amnion-folds become smoothed out again. Amnion and serosa
become then a simple epithelium, which throughout corresponds to the unmodified
type of blastoderm of Crustacea, Arachnida, and Myriopoda, and here seems
to share in the formation of the back. More complicated and very manifold
relations of dorsal closure and involution of the embryonal membranes occur
in other insects, of which Korschelt and Heider distinguish four different types:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>1. Involution under the formation of a continuous dorsal amnion-serosa-sac
(Odonata).</p>

<p class='c013'>2. Involution with exclusively dorsal absorption of the amnion (Doryphora).</p>

<p class='c013'>3. Involution with exclusively dorsal absorption of serosa and separation
of the amnion (Chironomus and Trichoptera).</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The first type occurs in the most primitive order of winged insects. The
second type (Coleoptera) appears to be an independently inherited form of
dorsal closure. In the first type, the formation of the amnion-serosa-sac is
initiated by a rupture of the two fused embryonic membranes. This rupture
in the ventral middle line occurs in Odonata only in the region of the head-section.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>In the second type only the amnion, in the third only the serosa are
concerned in this rupture, while in the fourth type both membranes remain

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The older views on the structure of
the layers of the primitive band of insects
were thoroughly unsatisfactory.
Bütschli first found that in the bee, by
a kind of folding process, an inner
layer of the primitive band arose.
Soon afterwards Kowalevsky, by the
employment of section-cutting and
thorough researches, laid the foundation
of a more exact knowledge of
these layers. He found that in
Hydrophilus a furrow extended along
the whole length of the primitive
band (Fig. 515, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>r</i>), which, while
invaginating or sinking in, gave rise
to the inner layer of the primitive
band, i.e. the common rudiment of
endoderm and mesoderm (Fig. 539,
<i>A-C</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Kowalevsky also found similar conditions
in the honey-bee (Apis),
Lepidoptera, and other forms. The
furrow above mentioned must be regarded
as a very long gastrula invagination,
extending along the entire
ventral side of the embryo, and the
edges of the furrow as a long-drawnout
blastopore. The tube arising in
Hydrophilus through the closing of
the furrow we may regard as a primitive
intestinal canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first rudiment of the gastrula
furrow appears in insects as two folds
extending along both sides of the
median line in the thickened ventral
plate (Fig. 536, <i>f</i>), through whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>formation a more median section of the ventral plate, the so-called
middle plate (<i>m</i>), becomes separated from the side plates (<i>s</i>). As
the middle plate curves in and becomes overgrown by the folds
forming the edges of the blastopore, the gastrula-tube (Fig. 539,
<i>A</i>, <i>r</i>) is formed, and furnishes the rudiments of the lower (inner)
layer. The ectoderm, then, according to Heider, arises from the
lateral plates of the primitive band. The growth of the edges
of the blastopore, by which the closure of the gastrula-tube
is effected, takes place latest in the region of the most anterior
part of the furrow (Fig. 515, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>), corresponding to that
place in the primitive band in which the stomodæum afterwards
develops.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During the invagination of the middle plate and its transformation
into the gastrula-tube a change takes place in its histological
character (Fig. 539, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>). While it originally consists of a
high cylinder epithelium, which after farther changes becomes
divided into several layers, since the wedge-shaped single cells
push themselves over each other, the cells in later stages become
more and more cubical or irregularly
polygonal (Fig. 539, <i>B</i>), and are irregularly
arranged. At the same time the
gastrula-tube is compressed in a dorso-ventral
direction. While it in this way
spreads out laterally under the side
plates (ectoderm), its originally circular
primitive lumen passes into the form
of a horizontal fissure, which in Hydrophilus
long remains as the boundary
between the two layers of the inner
(or lower) membrane. (Korschelt and
Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'>There are numerous variations of the process
of gastrulation, which are by Korschelt and
Heider divided into three types, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. Through invagination and formation of a tube (Fig. 539, <i>A</i>, Hydrophilus,
Musca, Pyrrhocoris, etc.).</p>

<p class='c013'>2. By a lateral overgrowth (Fig. 537, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera).</p>

<p class='c013'>3. By an inward growth of cells from a median furrow (Aphides and Trichoptera).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The cellular layer arising from the gastrula invagination (lower
layer) forms the common germ of the endoderm and mesoderm. It
has only recently become known how these two germ-layers of insects
have become differentiated. Kowalevsky first discovered in Musca
that the greatest part of the lower (inner) layer yielded mesoderm
exclusively, and that a cell-mass only corresponding to the most
anterior and posterior end of the primitive band was used in the
formation of the endoderm. We must therefore, in insects, speak
of a fore and a hinder endodermal rudiment. In proportion, now,
as the ectodermal invaginations, which are destined to form the
stomodæum and the proctodæum sink beneath the surface of the
embryo, the cell-masses of which the two endodermal rudiments are
composed are pushed farther in, and a separation between them
and the mesoderm is thus effected. The two endodermal rudiments
now form accumulations of cells which lie closely adjacent to the
blind ends of the stomodeal and the proctodeal invaginations.
They soon widen out into two hour-glass-shaped rudiments, which
are directed with their concavities towards each other, but with their
convex side towards the nearest pole of the egg. They soon change
their form; two lateral stripes grow out from them, and each now
assumes the form of a <span class='mono'>U</span> (Fig. 538, <i>en′</i>). The limbs of the fore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>and hind <span class='mono'>U</span>-shaped rudiment are directed toward each other, and
grow towards each other until they meet, and are fused together.
Thus the endodermal rudiments arising out of the fusion of the two
<span class='mono'>U</span>-shaped rudiments form two stripes extending along the primitive
band and situated mostly under the primitive segments. At the
two ends the endodermal rudiment fuses with the stomodeal and
proctodeal invaginations. These lateral endodermal streaks now
spread out, and gradually begin to grow over the yolk, on whose
outer surface they lie. This overgrowth makes the greater advance
on the ventral side, so that the two endodermal streaks first unite
in the ventral median line and afterward in the dorsal. The yolk
in this way passes completely into the interior of the rudiment of
the mid-intestine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Kowalevsky has already proved that it is the median parts only
of the inner layer which at the two ends of the primitive band
become separated as endodermal rudiments through the advance of
the stomodeal and proctodeal invaginations: the lateral portions
become mesoderm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Kowalevsky has compared the germ-layers of insects with those of Sagitta.
This comparison is supported by the later researches of Heider and of Wheeler
on Coleoptera. (See Korschelt and Heider, p. 809.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Relations somewhat different from the common type of formation of germ-layers
occur in Hymenoptera. Kowalevsky and also Grassi agree that here
also the endoderm originally forms a part of the lower (inner) layer. But the
separation of the endoderm from the mesoderm goes on in Apis in such a way
that the two ends of the inner layer pass up to the dorsal side of the egg, where
the fore and hind rudiments of the endoderm extending along the back of the
embryo grow together. When the two horseshoe-shaped rudiments have met
each other and become fused, the enclosing of the yolk begins, which accordingly
here proceeds from the dorsal towards the ventral side, instead of <i>vice
versa</i>. As a result the endodermal cell-layer in Apis (and also Chalicodoma)
at first does not lie under the primitive band, but on the dorsal side of the
egg under that flat epithelium, which, arising from the amnion-fold, completes
the provisional closure of the back.</p>

<p class='c013'>The yolk-cells and secondary yolk-segmentation are discussed by Korschelt
and Heider at this point. The yolk-cells are elements scattered throughout the
yolk and which partly remain in the yolk during the formation of the blastoderm
(Fig. 507, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>), but which in part through a later immigration pass out
of the blastoderm into the yolk. Graber has proved the fact of the migration
of cells from the lower layer into the yolk, and his observations have been confirmed
by other authors. Indeed, in certain cases (Melolontha), these later
immigrant cells are clearly distinguishable by their histological characters from
those originally found in the yolk.</p>

<p class='c013'>The yolk-cells are regularly scattered throughout the yolk. Their use to the
embryo lies in the fact that they absorb the particles of yolk, which they digest
and thus reduce to a fluid condition. It usually happens that after the complete
formation of the primitive band there results a delimitation of the areas
enclosing each yolk-cell, and this occurrence is called <i>secondary yolk-division</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>In special cases (Apis, Musca) this occurrence seems not to take place. The
yolk-cells are still, after the complete formation of the mid-intestine, to be
recognized in the yolk-remnants filling the interior of the same, and gradually
become absorbed.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>k.</i> Farther development of the mesoderm. Formation of the body-cavity</h4>

<p class='c016'>We have seen that by means of an invagination extending throughout
the entire length of the primitive band a layer of cells is produced
which soon spreads out on the inner side of the band and thus
forms a second lower (inner) layer (Fig. 539, <i>C</i>). From this inner
layer is separated at the anterior and posterior ends of the primitive
band, the endoderm, which lies in direct contact with the invaginations
of the proctodæum and stomodæum. The remainder, by far
the most extensive part of the inner layer, is the mesoderm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mesoderm now becomes divided into two lateral streaks
(mesodermal streaks), by the withdrawal of its cells from the
median line (Fig. 539, <i>D</i>). This withdrawal is not, however,
always a complete one. In the free median space thus formed, the
yolk often forms the so-called <i>median yolk-ridge</i>. Segmentally arranged
cavities soon appear in the lateral region of the mesoderm
(the primitive segmental cavities), and the bordering mesoderm-cells
arrange themselves in the form of an epithelium, and constitute
the wall of the primitive segments or cœlom-sac. (Korschelt
and Heider).</p>

<p class='c013'>The primitive segmental cavities in general arise through a split in the mesoderm.
In Phyllodromia, according to Heymons, the primitive segments are very
extensive. The mesoderm, at the time of the formation of the rudiments of
the appendages, is raised with the ectoderm from the surface of the yolk, and
in this way there arise in each segment cavities, which, since they are surrounded
by mesodermal elements, become the closed cœlom-sacs (Fig. 540,
<i>c</i>, <i>c′</i>, <i>c″</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>The cœlom-sacs differ in different groups. They are largest in Orthoptera
(Phyllodromia), where they take up almost all the cell material of the mesoderm
in their formation, and exhibit certain conditions recalling those of Peripatus.
The very large primitive segmental cavities, which in Orthoptera also extend
into the rudiments of the appendages (Fig. 540, <i>B</i>, <i>ex</i>), in their later stages are,
through the formation of a constriction, divided into a dorsal and a ventral half
(Fig. 540, <i>B</i>, <i>c′</i>, <i>c″</i>). The ventral portions of these cavities extending into the
extremities soon disappear, while the cells of their walls lose their epithelial
nature, and group themselves irregularly into a sort of mesenchym. In this
tissue, then, arises, partly through a separation among its cells, partly through
the elevation of the same from the upper surface of the yolk, <i>the definite body-cavity</i>.
The dorsal portions of the primitive segmental cavities remain unchanged
a longer time in order to play a rôle in the formation of the intestinal muscular
layer, of the heart, pericardial septum, and sexual organs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the highest groups of insects (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera)
the primitive segments are not so extensively developed (Fig. 539, <i>D-F</i>, <i>us</i>).
They here form only relatively small sacs situated in the lateral parts of the
primitive band which correspond to the dorsal section of the cœlom-sacs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>Orthoptera. The ventral part is here from the very outset replaced by a mesenchym.
As a result in these forms also no cœlomic diverticula occur in the rudiments
of the extremities.</p>

<p class='c013'>The definite body-cavity of insects arises entirely independent of the cœlom
cavities, and in fact, as Bütschli showed, through the separation of the primitive
band from the yolk (Fig. 539, <i>F</i>, <i>l</i>). It appears bounded on the one hand
by the surface of the yolk, on the other side by the irregularly arranged
mesenchym cells. Originally we can in cross-sections distinguish three separate
cavities of the definite body-cavity (in Hydrophilus according to Heider), a
median and two larger paired lateral ones which later fuse with each other and
with wide lacunæ (<i>e.g.</i> in the appendages) arising by the separation of the
mesenchym cells. We refer the compartments of the definite body-cavity, as
in Peripatus, to the primary body-cavity or segmentation-cavity. They are
only lacunæ in the area of the mesenchym, and throughout bear the character
of a pseudocœl.</p>

<p class='c013'>In later stages of embryonic development the cœlom-sacs and the definite
body-cavity enter into communication with one another (Fig. 523, <i>A</i>, <i>us</i>, <i>lh</i>).
(Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the hinder cœlom-sacs unite through the degeneration of the transverse
dissepiments which separate them. After this a fissure opens in the median
wall of the cœlomic sac, through which its cavity unites with the definite body-cavity.
In the subsequent changes which the wall of the cœlom-sacs undergoes,
these can be recognised no longer as separate divisions of the whole body-cavity.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>l.</i> Formation of organs</h4>

<p class='c016'><b>The nervous system.</b>—As we have already seen (p. 554), the rudiments
of the ventral nervous cord arise, after the gastrula invagination
is completed, as two ectodermal thickenings situated on each
side of the median line, the so-called primitive rolls or strips
(Fig. 528, <i>s</i>), which extend from the centre of the procephalic lobes
of the head to the last segment, enclosing between them the single
median “primitive groove” (Fig. 539, <i>C</i>, <i>pr</i>, and <i>pw</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after the appearance of the primitive strips, the first traces
of segmentation may be detected. The ventral cord is from the
first in direct connection and continuous with the brain. From the
segmental expansions of the primitive strip arise the ventral nervous
ganglia, and from the intersegmental constrictions are developed
the paired longitudinal commissures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Transverse sections of the ectoderm in the region of the primitive
strips (Figs. 539, <i>C</i>, and 517) show several layers of cells. Of
these cellular layers the deeper ones afterwards, by a kind of
delamination, separate from the superficial ones and form the
“lateral cords,” <i>i.e.</i> the germs of the longitudinal cords of the ventral
ganglionic cord. Meanwhile the primitive groove (<i>pr</i>) deepens
and forms an invagination extending between the lateral cords. The
cells at the bottom of this invagination form the so-called “median
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>cord,” and give rise to the transverse commissures connecting the
ganglia.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Wheeler has detected in the rudiment of the ventral cord of several Orthoptera,
on the upper surface of the lateral cords, four large cells which he calls <i>neuroblasts</i>
(Figure 541, <i>n<sub>1</sub>-n<sub>4</sub></i>), from
which cells arise by budding and
become arranged in vertically arranged
layers or pillars (<i>z</i>). Graber
has observed them in Stenobothrus
and Viallanes in Mantis. These
neuroblasts are only present in the
inter-ganglionic region, and soon
move back to the hinder side of the
transverse commissures.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first there is a pair of
ganglia to each of the 16 trunk-segments
of the embryo, but
afterwards these become more
or less fused together; thus
those of the three gnathal segments unite to form the subœsophageal
ganglion of the adult, and the last abdominal ganglia are fused
together and move a little anteriorly (see also pp. 227, 228).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Development of the brain.</b>—The supraœsophageal ganglion is due
to the spreading out of the procephalic lobes. The rudiment of the
brain is due to a thickening of the ectoderm on the sides of the
mouth and of the forehead, this expansion of germinal brain-cells
being the direct continuation of the primitive rolls or strips, and
which finally becomes differentiated into the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum,
and tritocerebrum, as stated on p. 228.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ganglion opticum, now regarded as a part of the compound
eye, arises as an ectodermal thickening on each side of the rudimentary
brain. The optic ganglion belongs exclusively to the foremost
division of the brain (see also p. 227).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Development of the eyes.</b>—Compound eyes do not appear until the
beginning of pupal life, the single eye (ocellus) being the primitive
organ of vision. The ocellus of Acilius, according to Patten,
arises as a pit or depression of the ectoderm (Fig. 542). The
long hypodermal cells which form the walls of this pit or hollow
are arranged in a single layer, and bear at their free ends a striated
cuticular edge (<i>c</i>), while from their inner or basal end arise the fibres
destined to form the common optic nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a later stage (Fig. 542, <i>B</i>), the eye-pit is closed over, the
edges growing over and covering the deeper part of the eye. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>way there arises out of the pit-like rudiment a two-layered
optic cup. The outer or superficial layer (<i>l</i>) becomes in its central
part the crystalline lens, while the peripheral parts form the
iris. From the cuticular striated border of these cells arise the
chitinous or corneal lens. On its outer edge the superficial layer of
the eye passes gradually into the unmodified hypodermis (<i>h</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The inner, deeper layer of
the eye, which forms the contracted
cup-shaped portion,
appears to be the rudimentary
retina (<i>r</i>). From its cuticular
rod-like or fibrous edge arise
the visual rods. There soon arise certain peculiarities characteristic
of the eye of Acilius, <i>i.e.</i> the fissure (<i>sp</i>) bordered by the horizontally
situated rods of the large retina-cells (<i>x</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the farther developed eye (Fig. 543) there is a flattening of the
cup-shaped inner edge, by which the bottom of the eye is levelled
and the little rods belonging to it stand up vertically (Fig. 543,
<i>B</i>, <i>st</i>). Then the cells belonging to the edge of the retinal cup (<i>m</i>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>are turned in, forming an inverted layer constituting the germs of a
third layer interpolated between the two chief layers of the eye.
(Korschelt and Heider, from Patten.) Patten concludes that the
structure of the retina in the larval ocelli of insects is much like
that of myriopods, and that the whole eye is constructed on the
same plan as that of Peripatus and most molluscs.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Intestinal canal and glands.</b>—The intestinal or digestive canal is
primitively divided, as already stated on p. 299, into three sections,
of which the anterior and posterior are called respectively the
stomodæum and proctodæum, and are invaginations of the ectoderm,
forming sacs whose blind ends face the future site of the
mid-intestine. The fore-intestine (stomodæum) in most cases arises
earlier than the proctodæum. Its muscles are derived from the
mesoderm. From the stomodæum arises at an early date an unpaired
dorsal invagination out of which develops the ganglion
frontale and the pharyngeal nerve.</p>

<p class='c013'>The absorption of the ends of the blind sacs of the fore and hind intestine,
and opening up of the passage into the mid-intestine, occur rather early in embryonic
life. In the wasps and bees, as well as the larva of the ant-lion, the
mid-intestine remains closed at the end, not communicating with the proctodæum,
which has an exclusively excretory function (Fig. 497).</p>

<p class='c007'>The mid-intestine arises from two originally separate rudiments,
<i>i.e.</i> the fore and hind endodermal rudiments, which at the outset
stand in the most intimate relation with the invagination of the
fore and hind intestine. Originating as a simple collection of cells,
so closely adjoining these invaginations that Voeltzkow, Patten, and
Graber derived them directly through outgrowths of them, they
become extended by advancing cell-multiplication until they assume
a <span class='mono'>U</span>-shaped form. The legs of the <span class='mono'>U</span>-shaped rudiment are in the
anterior endodermal mass, directed backwards; those in the posterior
mass, on the other hand, are directed anteriorly. These legs
grow towards each other until they become fused together, forming
two paired endodermal streaks, which pass under the primitive band
along its whole length, and are fused with it at the fore and hind
ends. In these places they stand in intimate union with the proctodeal
and stomodeal invaginations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paired endodermal streaks belong to the lateral portions of
the primitive band. As a rule, they lie directly under the row of
cœlom-sacs (Fig. 539, <i>F</i>). The dorsal wall of the primitive segments
stands consequently in intimate contact with the endodermal
streaks. On this wall of the primitive segments an active cell-growth
takes place, and the cell-material produced in this way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>which separates from the dorsal wall of the primitive segments,
forms the outer or splanchnic layer of the rudiment of the mid-intestine
(<i>spm</i>, Figs. 539, <i>F</i>, 544, <i>sp</i>). What remains of the dorsal
wall of the cœlom-sacs after this separation joins the genital
rudiments and gives rise to the so-called terminal thread-plate
(Fig. 544, <i>ef</i>). The endodermal streaks, with the splanchnic layer
lying next to them, may now be considered as the rudiments of the
mid-intestine (Fig. 530, <i>m</i>, etc.). These are noticeable in the following
stages by their considerable lateral growth; they spread
out over the upper surface of the yolk, around which they finally
entirely grow (Figs. 539, <i>C-F</i>, 544, 545). This growth around the
yolk goes on in most cases in such a way as to unite the two mid-intestinal
streaks in the region of the ventral median line with each
other. Then afterwards their union on the dorsal side takes place
(Figs. 539, <i>F</i>, 545). The yolk thus passes completely into the
interior of the mid-intestine, and with it the remains of the dorsal
tube or dorsal organ, when such an one is present.</p>

<p class='c013'>For their serial arrangement, see

mouth are in reality transformed nephridia
originating from the mesoderm,
while the salivary glands of insects are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>clearly ectodermal structures. We must, therefore, they add, leave to later
researches the question of the homology of these organs, also of their relations
to the similar glands of Peripatus.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The urinary tubes.</b>—These excretory vessels arise as paired evaginations
of the hind intestine or proctodæum. They are ectodermal
structures arising as lateral diverticula of
the intestinal cavity (Fig. 546). Figure
547 represents their mode of origin at the
anterior end of the proctodæum of a locust.
It will be seen that there are 10 primary
tubes. There are 150 such tubes in locusts,
or 10 groups of 15 each. The 15 secondary
tubes probably arise from the primary
ones in the manner described by Hatschek
for Lepidoptera (see his Taf. III, Fig. 7).</p>

<p class='c013'>While the Malpighian tubes usually first arise
as diverticula of the proctodæum, in the Hymenoptera
(Apis and Chalicodoma) they appear, even
before the completion of the proctodæum, as
invaginations of the ectoderm which at first open
out on the outer surface of the primitive band. They seem, then, in some
degree, to be similar to the tracheal rudiments, which perhaps is the reason
why they have been homologized with them, a view which we do not share,
and in which Carrière does not concur. They afterwards pass, with the growing
proctodæum, into the interior of the embryo. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The heart.</b>—The dorsal vessel is first indicated, according to
Korotneff, by a long string or row of cells (<i>cardioblasts</i>), which
on each side border the mesodermal layer of the primitive band
(Figs. 544, <i>h</i>, 548, <i>h</i>). In the advancing growth of the primitive
band around the yolk, this rudiment steadily passes up more towards
the dorsal side. It is in connection with the wall of the primitive
segment (Figs. 544 and 548), and represents the point at which the
dorsal wall of the cœlom-sac passes into the lateral wall. According
to Korotneff, the cardioblasts arise directly through a migration out
from the wall of the primitive segment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Gryllotalpa the formation of the dorsal organ, which, as
Korotneff states, is in this insect nothing else than a stopper which
fills up the dorsal gap of the body-wall of the embryo, is effected by
the rupture of the embryonal membranes. The serosa is drawn
together to form a thick plate (Fig. 523, <i>A</i>, <i>rp</i>), and the much
degenerated amnion-folds (<i>am</i>) which are laterally attached to it
have moved from the edges of the primitive streak (<i>*x-*y</i>) far
towards the dorsal side (see Fig. 539, <i>C</i>, which represents a similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>stage). The distance between the rudiment of the amnion-fold and
the lateral edge of the primitive band (<i>*x</i>, <i>*y</i>) is occupied by an epithelial
lamella (<i>l</i>), in which we recognize the earlier amnion. This
lamella does not lie directly on the yolk, but is separated from it
by a spacious blood-lacuna (<i>A</i>, <i>bs</i>), in which can be seen numerous
blood-corpuscles which have migrated in from the mesoderm of the
primitive band. The cardioblasts which have arisen from the wall
of the primitive segment (<i>us</i>) are on each side arranged into the
form of a furrow (<i>gr</i>), which bounds the blood sinus below.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By the continuous growth of the primitive band around the yolk,
after the resulting invagination and degeneration of the dorsal plate,
the two blood-lacunæ unite together on the dorsal side into a single
one (<i>B</i>, <i>bs</i>). These constitute the first cavity of the heart. The
vascular furrows (<i>gr</i>) come in contact with each other and grow
together, and the wall of the heart is thus formed. Ayers states
that in Œcanthus the heart is formed in the head region only after
the yolk-sac has passed entirely within the body. The venous ostia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>arise by two paired invaginations of the lateral walls, forming a
split at their bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rudiment of the heart stands, as we have seen, in intimate
union with the primitive segments. Out of the lateral walls of
these segments, after giving off the elements of the somatic mesoderm,
arises an epithelial plate which becomes the rudiment of
the pericardial septum or dorsal diaphragm (Figs. 523, <i>A-C</i>, <i>dd</i>,
544–545, <i>ps</i>). As soon as the two halves of the rudiments of the
heart have united with each other in the dorsal middle line, the two
halves of the pericardial septum unite with each other and form
the wall to the pericardial cavity and shut it off from the rest of
the body-cavity. For a long time the pericardial septum remains
in union with the wall of the heart. Afterwards, however, it separates
from it (Fig. 523, <i>C</i>, <i>dd</i>). (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The statements of other authors (Ayers, Grassi, Patten, Tichomeroff, Carrière,
Heider, Heymons, etc.) as to the mode of origin of the heart in insects of
other orders are all similar to the type described in Gryllotalpa. The difference
consists mostly in the fact that the two large blood-lacunæ are wanting or only
exist to a slight extent. It results that the rudiment of the cavity of the heart
in the earlier stages is of slight extent and often scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Œcanthus (Ayers) and in Gryllotalpa, the hinder section of the heart
is the first to develop, the development advancing from behind forward.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The blood-corpuscles.</b>—Blood-cells are said by Korotneff to be, in
Gryllotalpa, at an early period present almost everywhere between
the yolk and mesoderm; they are derived, as he states, from the cells
of the somatic mesoderm layer, which has lost its connection with the
other parts of the mesoderm, and fall into the body-cavity. Ayers
states that the blood-corpuscles arise from serosa nuclei which have
passed into the body-cavity, where they become more vesicular,
and ultimately all of the nuclear substance goes to form from one
to three spherical bodies, which are surrounded by the common
membrane.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These bodies are blood-corpuscles and are free nucleoli immediately
on the rupturing of the vesicle which surrounds them.”
(Ayers, Pl. 22, Figs. 1, 3, p. 250.) More recently, Schaeffer has
observed in caterpillars certain cell-complexes associated with the
fat-body which he has called blood-forming masses.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Musculature, connective tissue, fat-body.</b>—The muscles of various
parts of the body, as well as the connective tissue, arise by histological
differentiation from the somatic layer of the mesoderm
(Fig. 523, <i>so</i>). The fat-body originates from the same source, as
shown by the researches of Kowalevsky, Grassi, and of Carrière. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>Hydrophilus a dorsal band of the fat-body passes over the digestive
canal arising by direct transformation of the wall of the cœlom-sacs.
But also the other portions of the fat-body, as the fat-body lobes
accompanying the tracheal system, are of undoubted mesodermal
origin. Heymons’ observations on the cockroach (Phyllodromia)
agree with the foregoing view. In this insect at a very early period
certain cells in the wall of the cœlom-sacs undergo a change, and
may be recognized as the rudiments of what are afterwards fat-body
tissues (Fig. 540, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <i>f</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The reproductive organs.</b>—Our knowledge of the mode of development
of the genital organs is in a less satisfactory state than that
of the other organs. It is now known that the rudiments of the
sexual glands belong to the mesoderm, and are developed from the
wall of the cœlom-sacs. In the cockroach (Phyllodromia), the most
generalized of the winged insects, as Heymons has shown, in the
earlier stages of the embryo separate genital cells are already distinguished
by their histologically different characters from the other
mesodermal cells. The genital cells are larger and show a feebly
stained nucleus with a clear nucleolus. These genital cells, which
are transformed normal mesodermal cells, lie originally within the
mesoderm layer or on the surface of this layer turned towards the
yolk, on the edge of the segments. After the complete formation
of the cœlom-sacs we find them (Fig. 549, <i>gz</i>) in the dissepiments
which separate the successive cœlom-sacs from one another. Here
new genital cells are constantly formed through the transformation
of mesoderm cells. The development of the genital cells takes
place in the 2d to the 7th abdominal segments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards the genital cells pass into the interior of the cœlom-sacs,
and soon pass to the dorsal wall of the same (Fig. 540, <i>A</i>, <i>gz</i>)
and enter between the cells of this wall. The cœlom-sacs (<i>c</i>) show
in cross-section in this stage a triangular outline, so that we can
distinguish a dorsal, lateral, and median wall. The dorsal wall lies
next to the surface of the yolk, and afterwards gives rise by separation
or splitting to the splanchnic mesoderm (Fig. 544, <i>sp</i>), while
from its remains the terminal thread-plate (<i>ef</i>) originates. The
lateral wall, which is turned towards the ectoderm of the primitive
band, is intimately concerned in the formation of the somatic layer
(Fig. 540, <i>C</i>, <i>so</i>) of the mesoderm. Out of what remains arises the
pericardial septum (Fig. 544, <i>ps</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>When the genital cells have entered into the dorsal wall of the
primitive segments, they are already so numerous that they form a
continuous series extending from before backward. The genital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>rudiment consists, then, of a string of cells lying on each side in
the dorsal wall of the primitive segments, which extend from the
2d to the 7th abdominal segments. In the formation of these strings
or rows of cells not only are the genital
cells concerned, but also still undifferentiated
mesoderm cells (Fig. 540, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>),
which originate from the dorsal wall of
the cœlom-sacs and lie next to the genital
cells. Some of these last tend to envelop
the genital cells. We designate them the
epithelial cells of the genital rudiments
(<i>ep</i>), while others form a cellular cord
which takes a position medial and ventral
to the genital cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the genital cells in the female
arise only the egg-cells (and the nutritive
cells in those forms which have such).
The follicular epithelium of the egg-tube,
on the other hand, also the corresponding
cells of the terminal
chamber, originate
from the epithelial cells.
Phyllodromia and Orthoptera
in general, to
which this description
applies, show in this
respect tolerably simple
relations, since the germinal
or terminal compartment
of the ovary in
them is composed of relatively
few cells. In most
other insects, and especially
those which have
a great number of food-cells
in the ovary, the
germinal chamber (Keimfach)
is extraordinarily
large.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ventral cellular cord (<i>cz</i>) develops into the proximal part of
the oviduct, which widens out and receives the single egg-tubes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cœlom-sacs in the farther course of their development,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>through the retrograde development of the parts extending into the
appendages, through the development of the fat-bodies and through
the delamination of the somatic and the splanchnic mesoderm layer,
become greatly diminished in size. Finally, there remains left of
them only a rather small cavity (<i>c</i>), which is bordered on the side
by the rudiment of the pericardial septum (<i>ps</i>) and within by the
terminal thread-plate (<i>ef</i>). The dorsally situated point where these
two lamellæ pass into each other seems to stand in intimate connection
with the cells of the rudiment of the heart (<i>h</i>). The cord-like
genital rudiment
hangs from the terminal
thread-plate
as from a mesentery
(Fig. 549, <i>gz</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Together with
the growth of the
primitive band
around the yolk,
and the formation
of the back,
the paired rudiments
of the heart
gradually extend
to the neighborhood
of the dorsal
median line, followed
by the genital
rudiments
which are connected
with them
by the terminal thread-plates. The genital rudiments advance thus
to the dorsal side of the developing mid-intestine (Fig. 545, <i>gz</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The terminal thread-plate (<i>ef</i>) is at first a simple epithelial plate.
Soon, however, follows an arrangement of its cells whereby they
appear to be arranged in vertical rows, each one of which corresponds
to a developing ovarian tube. In this way the terminal
thread-plate separates into the separate terminal threads of the ovarian
tubes (Fig. 550, <i>ef</i>). In this process of division the uppermost
dorsal edge of the terminal thread-plate takes no part. From it
afterwards grows a thread which extends anteriorly, which becomes
the common terminal thread of all the ovarian tubes, the so-called
Müller’s thread. This is originally united with the pericardial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>septum, but seems in later stages to have no longer an intimate
connection with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The formation of the single ovarian tubes, which in Phyllodromia
number about 20, is accomplished by the extension of indentations
from the dorsal side towards the ventral side of the ovarian rudiment
(Fig. 550). At the same time the epithelial cells (<i>ep</i>), which
were originally situated in part between the genital cells, become
arranged in the form of an epithelium on the surface of the ovarian
tubes, which soon forms on its outer surface a structureless cuticular
<i>tunica propria</i>. The outer peritoneal membrane of the ovary becomes
formed of the cells of the surrounding tissue of the fat-body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The genital rudiment originally extends, as already stated, from
the 2d to the 7th abdominal segment. In the last, however, the
genital cells at first occur only sparingly, and afterwards completely
disappear, so that here the genital cord appears composed of epithelial
cells only. This part is the rudiment of the oviduct proper,
and forms a direct continuation of the above-mentioned cell-cord
which is situated ventralward from the genital cells, from which,
as we have seen, the proximal cup-shaped section of the oviduct is
formed. The hinder section of the oviduct turns down ventrally in
order to unite at the boundary between the 7th and 8th abdominal
segments with the hypodermis. The rudiment of the oviduct originally
forms a solid strand of cells. Afterwards a cavity is formed
by the separation of the cells.</p>

<p class='c013'>In later stages there is a considerable shortening of the genital rudiment, so
that it occupies a smaller number of abdominal segments than at first. At the
same time the single ovarian tubes pass out of their originally vertical position
into one more horizontal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paired connections of the rudiments of the oviducts with the
hypodermis of the intersegmental furrow between the 7th and 8th
abdominal segments reminds us of the conditions in the Ephemeridæ.
This is the primitive condition in insects. In the female of Phyllodromia
there is developed during larval life, from an ectodermal
invagination, an unpaired terminal section of the genital passage,
which becomes the genital pouch in which the egg-case (oötheca)
is held. This genital pouch is formed, as Haase has already proved,
by the withdrawal of the chitinous ventral plate of the 8th and 9th
abdominal segment by invagination into the interior of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The development of the efferent passages has been investigated
by Nusbaum in the cockroach (Periplaneta) and in the Pediculina.
He found that only the vasa deferentia and the oviducts arise from
the hinder cord of the germs of the sexual glands, that is, out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>the mesodermal rudiments, while the other parts of the sexual
efferent apparatus (uterus, vagina, receptaculum seminis, ejaculatory
duct, penis, and all the accessory glands) develop from the
integumental epithelium and are of ectodermal origin. In fact,
the unpaired parts (uterus, penis, receptaculum seminis, unpaired
glands) have developed from paired rudiments, being outgrowths of
the hypodermis. The hinder portions of the rudiments of the sexual
glands approach these hypodermal growths and fuse with them.
Through a median fusion of the paired hypodermal growths arise
the germs of the unpaired organs. These observations are in complete
agreement with the results at which Palmén arrived by
anatomical investigation (see p. 492).</p>

<p class='c007'>From the agreement of the position of the sexual openings in
Phyllodromia with the conditions observed in the Ephemeridæ, with
which the Perlidæ also agree, we conclude that in the entire group
of insects an opening between the 7th and 8th abdominal segments
is the primitive condition, and that only by a secondary shifting
has a more posterior position of the opening (in many forms)
been brought about. In this category we must certainly include
the Thysanura, in which the sexual opening is single and situated
between the 8th and 9th abdominal segments.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Development of the male germinal glands.</b>—These rudiments arise
in exactly the same manner as those of the female. Sexual differentiation
takes place in the later embryonic stages. We then notice
that in the male four masses of genital cells become surrounded by
epithelial cells. These masses, which form the germs of the four
testicular follicles of Phyllodromia, stand in intimate union with
the rudiment of the vas deferens, and in the later stages move in
connection with the latter, away from and behind the original
genital rudiment. There remains, then, with the terminal thread-plate
a remnant of the genital rudiment, which, according to Heymons,
forms the female part of the original hermaphroditic genital
rudiment, and in special cases may develop even into rudimentary
egg-tubes and eggs. The rudimentary organ arising out of this
genital rudiment may also be demonstrated in the adult male of
Phyllodromia.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the female the oviduct arises directly out of the originally
established efferent passage. In the male, on the contrary, it is
not, along its whole length, transformed into the vas deferens, but
its distal terminal portion degenerates and is replaced by a newly
formed terminal portion of the vas deferens, which then unites with
the ectodermal ductus ejaculatorius. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>On reviewing the facts as to the origin of the sexual organs, as in Phyllodromia,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
as just described, it will be seen that they afford proof that in the
derivation of the genital cells from the epithelial cells of the cœlom-sacs, there
is a direct agreement with the annelids. In the later development of the
paired genital glands, and of an efferent passage standing in direct union with
the glands themselves, there is a certain agreement with the conditions in
Peripatus. In the first place, the dorsal position of the genital glands is the
same in the two groups. On the other hand, the genital glands of Peripatus,
according to Sedgwick, are formed by direct fusion of the successive cœlom-sacs
(and a similar point of view has been taken by Heathcote for the myriopods),
hence it results that in Peripatus the genital cavities arise out of the
cœlom-cavities. In the insects, on the other hand, the genital rudiment lies,
to be sure, in the wall of the cœlom-sac, but the genital cavity (lumen of the
oviducts) in them arises separately from the cœlom-sacs, while the cœlom-cavities
finally become a small part of the definite body-cavity. We must consider
the conditions in Peripatus and the myriopods as the more primitive, directly
pointing to the annelids; on the other hand, those of the insects as derived
and secondary.</p>

<p class='c013'>If we attempt to homologize the sexual efferent passages of insects with those
of Peripatus, we are compelled to refer them to a modified pair of nephridia,
and the origin of the latter (Peripatus) from the mesoderm agrees with that
of insects. In general, however, in the development of the sexual outlets of
insects, there are no characters which can be regarded as favorable to such a
view. We must here accept the fact that the mode of development is secondary.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mention should be specially made of the fact we owe to Heymons, that in the
genital rudiment of Phyllodromia the genital cells and epithelial cells can be
distinguished from each other from the very beginning. This fact does not
favor the generally accepted view that the follicle-cells and egg-cells arise
through a later differentiation from one and the same kind of cell. From their
first origin, indeed, in Phyllodromia, both kinds of cells may be referred to the
same source.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mode of origin of the genital rudiments in Diptera and Aphides deserve
special mention. In these groups the sexual germs are present in very early
stages of life. This certainly in part is the result of the parthenogenetic and
pædogenetic mode of reproduction in the two groups, which leads to an early
differentiation of the sexual germs.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Diptera the first germs of the genital glands are represented by the
polar cells (Fig. 551, <i>pz</i>). In the asexual developing eggs of the oviparous
Cecidomyia larva, before the formation of the blastoderm, there separates from
the hinder pole (<i>D</i>) a rather large cell rich in granules, which soon divides into
two and afterwards four polar cells. After the completion of the blastoderm
these polar cells then pass in among the blastoderm cells (<i>G</i>) and into the
interior of the embryo, where they are in later stages symmetrically arranged
in two groups, and, enveloped by the cells of surrounding tissues, transformed
into the genital rudiments. (Metschnikoff.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In Chironomus (Fig. 552, <i>p</i>), according to Balbiani, two polar cells almost
simultaneously separate from the hinder pole of the egg, which, by division,
form a group of four and eight cells. Exactly as in the case in Cecidomyia,
these cells are taken within the embryo, where they lie divided into two groups
on each side of the proctodæum. In all the young, freshly hatched larvæ; these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>two spindle-shaped groups, whose cells soon increase in number, may be seen
situated dorsally on the side of the heart, enveloped by a clear cellular membrane
which ends before and behind in a ligament-like terminal thread. The
anterior terminal thread is the rudiment of the so-called Müller’s thread. The
thread at the posterior end is the rudiment of the paired efferent passage of
the genital glands. Through a division of the cells lying in the interior of the
rudiments of the ovaries, there results the formation of a rosette-shaped group
of cells which corresponds to the contents of an ovarian tube. With this view
of Balbiani the later observations of Ritter agree.</p>

<p class='c013'>As in the Diptera, so in the Aphides, the first germs of the genital organs are
differentiated very early in life. In the early stage in which through an invagination
from the hinder pole of the egg the first rudiment of the amnion-cavity
is formed, a group of cells becomes separated from the wall of this invagination
before the formation of the lower layer, which at this time lies as an
unpaired roundish mass within the embryo. This group of cells, according to
Balbiani and Witlaczil, has arisen by division of a single cell. Afterwards it
becomes horseshoe-shaped and divides into a number of roundish masses of
cells, which are arranged in similar numbers on each side of the median plane
of the body, and form the rudiments of the terminal fan (Endfächer). They
are covered by an epithelial envelope which passes anteriorly into the terminal
threads, posteriorly into the efferent passage. The origin of this epithelial case
is unknown. The efferent passages of the separate ovarian tubes are united into
a common oviduct, and this fuses with an unpaired ectodermal invagination
lying under the hind intestine from which the accessory sexual organs are
formed. (Korschelt and Heider from Metschnikoff, Witlaczil, Will.)</p>

<p class='c013'>In the Hymenoptera Ganin has observed in the embryo of Platygaster the
rudiments of the sexual glands in the form of two rounded masses situated near

as the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Uljanin studied these organs in the larva of the honey-bee. They are two
reniform bodies in the middle of which will soon appear the ovarian tubes.
They also give birth to the internal parts of the excretory ducts, while the external
part of the genital tube, as also the accessory glands which are connected
with it, are derived by an invagination of the hypodermis at the surface of the
penultimate segment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dohrn observed in the larva of ants the rudiments of the ovaries in the form
of two pyriform masses, each with eight prolongations which he regarded as

<p class='c013'>In Encyrtus Bugnion observed the rudiments of the sexual glands in the
middle of the larval period; they were rounded and with no apparent connection
with the neighboring
organs. Afterwards these
rudiments elongated, approached
nearer to the ventral
surface, and placed themselves
in relation with some small
cell-groups which appeared
under the rectum, and seemed
destined to form the efferent
canal (vas deferens) and accessory
glands of the genital
organs. He thought the sex
could be recognized in the
second half of larval life, the
male gland being distinguished
by its rounded shape and
smaller size; the ovary by its
oval form and larger size. In
larvæ ready to be transformed
the testis formed a cellular
mass enveloped by a cuticle,
and at its hinder end prolonged
into an epithelial cord,
which is undoubtedly the vas
deferens. The ovary had a
similar envelope, and from its
cellular mass arose epithelial cords which were destined to become the ovarian
tubes.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>m.</i> Length of embryonic life</h4>

<p class='c016'>The duration of embryonic life varies greatly in different insects.
The embryo of the blow-fly is fully developed in less than 24 hours,
that of the house-fly in 24 hours. In the locusts and tree-cricket
the embryos begin to develop at the end of the summer, continuing
to grow until the cool weather of autumn, when growth is arrested,
the later stages being finished in the latter part of the spring. It
is so, likewise, with the embryos of many moths and other insects.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><i>n.</i> The process of hatching</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This has been observed only in a few cases, and careful observations
as to the exact manner in which the embryo breaks the egg-shell
and frees itself from the amnion are much needed. Also the
rapid changes of form from that of the embryo within the egg-shell,
and that which it immediately assumes after breaking forth from
the shell and membranes, have yet to be observed; for these will
undoubtedly be found to have special phylogenetic significance.
Indeed, the phylogenetic importance of the latest embryonic changes
in insects just entering on the nymph or the larval stages is very
great, though little attention has as yet been bestowed upon the
matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the changes at the time of hatching, Wheeler tells us
that the cockroach (Phyllodromia), shortly after leaving its narrow
place in the egg-capsule, undergoes a peculiar change in shape.
Before hatching, and when confined in the egg-shell, the body is
about one-third as wide as thick; but soon after breaking out of the
chorion its body is much flattened, its dorso-ventral diameter being
only about a third as great as its greatest breadth. This shows that
the flattened shape of the body of cockroaches, which adapts them
for their life under bark and stones, is a very late inheritance, and
that these insects have descended from those with more cylindrical
bodies. The end of the body, also, which in the egg is bent underneath
the abdomen, is, after hatching, bent dorsally, as indicated
by the anal stylets, which now point directly upwards and outwards.
The spines and claws are developed shortly before hatching. In
the Locustidæ (Xiphidium, etc.) Wheeler has observed that the
pleuropodia, or 1st pair of abdominal temporary embryonic appendages,
are shed during hatching. All the other embryonic appendages
have also disappeared, except those which persist and have
rapidly become modified to form the cercopods, or the ovipositor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In locusts, as we have observed<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a> in the case of <i>Melanoplus spretus</i>,
the egg-shell bursts open at the head end, when the nymph, immediately
after extricating itself from the egg, casts off a thin pellicle
(the amnion), as we have also noticed in the case of the larvæ of the
flea, currant saw-fly, and other insects. Before the amnion is cast
off, the young nymph is almost motionless, but by slight movements
of the body draws itself, in about five minutes, out of the amnion.
The exact process of extraction is as follows: While it lies motionless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>it puffs out the thin, loose skin connecting the back of the head
with the front edge of the prothorax. The distention of this part
probably ruptures the skin, which slips over the head, the body
meanwhile curved over until the skin is drawn back from the head;
when the latter is thrown back, it withdraws its antennæ and legs,
and the skin is in a second of time pushed back to near the end of
the abdomen; finally, it draws its hind tarsi out of the skin, and in
a moment or two more the young locust frees itself, kicks away the
cast skin, which resembles a little white crumpled pellet, and which
has also been compared to a diminutive mushroom, and walks
actively off,—sometimes, however, with the cast skin adhering to
the end of the abdomen. Before the shedding
of the amnion the body and legs are soft and
flabby; immediately after, it walks firmly on
its legs. All the eggs hatched—at least one
or more hundreds—at about the same time, <i>i.e.</i>
before 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span></p>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 553.</span>—Locust just before the amnion is cast, enlarged.—Emerton <i>del.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The nymph of <i>Stagmomantis carolina</i> also
sheds an amnion-skin, like that of the locust;
but the embryo before casting it off is much
elongated, and probably, like the European
<i>Mantis religiosa</i>, the curious elongated embryos
have the same singular habit of suspending
themselves by threads, as shown in Fig. 554.</p>

<p class='c013'>The account by Pagenstecher of the first ecdysis of the European Mantis was
so extraordinary that we asked Professor Cockerell to collect the eggs of our
Stagmomantis in New Mexico and send them to us. This he has kindly done,
writing that he can “hardly recognize a true moult, since all that is cast off is
the egg-membrane. In short, Pagenstecher’s account must be not a little fanciful,
unless our insect differs very much in its development from <i>Mantis religiosa</i>.
The main change is that after leaving the egg the thorax enormously elongates,
producing a bulging out, and thrusting the head forward.” Our observations
on the alcoholic specimens fully corroborate Cockerell’s conclusions. Pagenstecher’s
figure of the embryo appears to be inaccurate. Sharp states that the
hatching nymphs remain suspended for some days until the “first change of
skin is effected.” This so-called “skin” is evidently the amnion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 17–year Cicada, after hatching, is enveloped by the amnion,
from which it soon extricates itself, and then drops deliberately to
the ground, “its specific gravity being so insignificant that it falls
through the air as gently and as softly as does a feather.” (Riley.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Other insects, as caterpillars, have room enough to turn around
within their shell and to eat their way through the walls of the
chorion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>The meat-fly, as we have observed, hatches in the following
manner. The embryo moves to and fro, the body twisting until
the exochorion is ruptured; the egg-shell splits longitudinally, and
in one or two seconds the larva pushes its way out through the
anterior end, and in a second or two more extricates itself from the
shell. The latter scarcely changes its form, and the larva slips out,
leaving the amnion within.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the case of a fossorial wasp, <i>Specius speciosus</i>, which carries
Cicadæ into its burrow, laying an elongated egg on the body under
the median thigh of its victim, the larva on hatching, Riley states,
“does not emerge from the skin of the egg, but
merely protrudes its head and begins at once to
draw nourishment from between the sternal
sutures of the Cicada.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The hatching spines.</b>—Animals belonging to
quite distinct classes are provided late in embryonic
life with hard knobs or spines, which
are temporary structures for the purpose of
breaking or cutting open the egg-shell, when it
is too thick and solid to be ruptured by the
movements of the embryo. The embryos of certain
lizards, turtles, the blind worm and some
snakes, of the crocodile, and even birds, as well
as the duckbill and Echidna, are provided with
them, always occurring, so far as we are aware,
on the end of the upper jaw. In the Arthropoda
similar structures have thus far only been met
with in myriopods and insects, though an analogous
structure on the cephalothorax of the
embryo of phalangids has been observed by
Balbiani. Metschnikoff describes and figures
a low conical spine serving this purpose situated on the embryonal
cuticle over the head of the advanced embryo of Strongylosoma,
and one on the 3d pair of mouth-parts of Geophilus.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the winged insects, the embryo of Forficula is said by Heymons
to bear a single spine between the eyes, which serves as an egg-tooth.
The embryo of the Hemerobiidæ, according to Hagen, “opens
the egg with an egg-burster like a saw.” (Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat.
Hist., xv, p. 247.) Riley states that the egg-burster, or <i>ruptor
ovi</i>, as he calls it, of <i>Corydalus cornutus</i>, has “the form of the common
immature mushroom,” and he adds that it is a part of the
amnion, being “easily perceived on the end of the vacated shell.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>Wheeler has observed three pairs of broad-based chitinous “hatching
spines” used by Doryphora in rupturing its embryonic envelopes,

<p class='c007'>The hatching spine of <i>Pulex canis</i> (Fig. 557) is a thin vertical
plate, like the edge of a knife, situated in the median line of the
head very near the posterior end, and is somewhat cultriform, the
upper edge slightly hollow, and turned up a little at the anterior
end. Though we did not see it working, it is situated at just the
point on the head where it would come in contact with the egg-shell,
and it was evident that the larva, by moving its head back and forth,
would produce a slight split in the chorion and cause it to burst
asunder. Later on in larval life it disappears, probably at the first
moult.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART III.—THE METAMORPHOSES OF INSECTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have seen that the embryo rapidly passes through extraordinary
changes of form, and now, after hatching, especially in the
insects with a complete metamorphosis, the animal continues to
undergo striking changes in form, in adaptation to different modes
of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The life of a winged insect, such as a butterfly, fly, or bee, may
be divided into four stages: the embryo, or egg state, the larva,
pupa, and imago,—the term <i>metamorphosis</i> being applied to the
changes after birth, or post-embryonic stages of life. The transformations
of the more specialized orders of insects involve wonderful
changes of form, which are only paralleled in other types of
animals by the metamorphoses of the echinoderms, of certain worms,
and of the Crustacea, as well as by those of the frog. An insect,
such as a butterfly or bee, during its post-embryonic life lives, so to
speak, three different lives, having distinct bodily structures and
existing under quite dissimilar surroundings and habits; so that a
caterpillar is practically a different animal from the pupa, and the
latter from the imago, with different organs, the appendages and
other structures being so modified as to be, so far as regards their
functions, radically different. These changes of functions or of
habits have also been plainly enough the exciting cause of the divergency
in structure of what fundamentally is one and the same organ,
the change having been brought about by adaptation of the same
organs to quite different uses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The changes are not only observable in the body and its appendages,
but also in the internal organs, and consequently are both
structural and physiological. The term <i>larva</i>, as applied to the
first stage of animals, is a very variable and indefinite one, that of
insects in general being a much more highly organized animal than
the larva of a worm, starfish, or crustacean.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The nymph as distinguished from the larval stage</h4>

<p class='c016'>As there is no marked difference between the different stages of
the young in the insects with an incomplete metamorphosis (Heterometabola),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>the chief difference being the possession of the rudiments
of wings and the absence of a resting stage, the terms <i>larva</i> and
<i>pupa</i> are in reality scarcely applicable to them, and we much prefer
the term <i>nymph</i>, first proposed by Lamarck for the active “pupa”
of Orthoptera, Hemiptera, the Odonata and Ephemeridæ, and
adopted in part by many. Indeed, in the more generalized and
older orders, the larval and pupal stages are not differentiated,
though the term <i>larval</i>, in its general sense, will probably always
be used; just as we speak of the larval stages of worms, echinoderms,
or Crustacea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Eaton in his elaborate work on the Ephemeridæ employs the term <i>nymph</i> to
designate all the aquatic or early stages in the development of the young after
hatching, and he urges that the old-fashioned usage of <i>larva</i> and <i>pupa</i> seem
scarcely worth retention. “Nymphs are young which live an active life, quitting
the egg at a tolerably advanced stage of morphological development and
having the mouth-parts formed after the same main type of construction as
those of the adult insect.” The word <i>nymph</i> is used in the same sense by
McLachlan, and by Cabot. Calvert also applies the term <i>nymph</i> “to the stage
of odonate existence between the egg and the transformation into the imago.”
On the other hand, Brauer applies the term <i>nymph</i> to the pupa of holometabolous
insects. For larval Hyatt proposes the term <i>nepionic</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> Stages or stadia of metamorphosis</h4>

<p class='c016'>The intervals or periods between the moults or ecdyses of caterpillars
and other eruciform larvæ are called stages or <i>stadia</i>; thus,
as most caterpillars moult four times, we have five stages or stadia,
or stage (stadium) I to V. As observed by Sharp, there is, unfortunately,
no term in general use to express the form of the insect at
the various stadia; “entomologists say, ‘the form assumed at the
first moult,’ and so on.” Hence he adopts a term suggested by
Fischer,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> and calls the insect as it appears after leaving the egg the
first <i>instar</i>, and what it is after the first moult the second instar,
and so on; hence the pupa, or chrysalis, which assumed that condition
after moulting five times would be the sixth instar, and the
butterfly itself would be the seventh instar.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Ametabolous and metabolous stages</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the Synaptera development is direct, the young differing
neither in form, structure, or habits from the adult. Hence they
are said to be <i>ametabolous</i>. Since there is an absence of even a tendency
to a partial metamorphosis, it is evident that the insects have
not inherited a tendency to undergo a transformation, but that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>an adaptation induced in the hexapod type after the first winged
insects appeared, and which became more marked in the more
specialized insects and at a period comparatively late in geological
history, <i>i.e.</i> perhaps at or soon after the beginning of the Carboniferous
period.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The transformations of the pterygote insects vary greatly in
degree, and it is difficult to draw the line between the grades.
Those in which the adults differ from the freshly hatched young
only or mainly in having wings are generally said to have an incomplete
or gradual metamorphosis. There is no inactive, resting, or
pupal stage, and the wings are acquired only after successive moults.
Insects with an incomplete metamorphosis are the Orthoptera,
Dermaptera, Platyptera (Mallophaga, Plecoptera, Corrodentia,
Embidæ), Ephemeridæ, Odonata, Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera,
with the exception of the male Coccidæ, in which there is a resting
or sub-nymph stage. As regards the number of moults in the
Synaptera, Grassi states that in Campodea there is a single fragmentary
ecdysis, while Sommers tells us that <i>Macrotoma plumbea</i>
sheds its skin throughout life, even after attaining its full size.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an example of the partial metamorphosis of the hemimetabolous
insects we may select that of the locust, in which there are five
moults and six stages (instars), as seen in Fig. 558, five of which
are nymphal. In the first two stages there are no rudiments of
wings, these appearing after the second moult. Besides the acquisition
of wings there are slight differences after each moult, both in
structure and color, besides size, so that we may always recognize
the comparative age and the particular stage of growth of any
individual.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We have watched the development of <i>Melanoplus spretus</i> from the egg to the
imago, and examined thousands of specimens which show the six stages. On
the other hand, European authors differ as to whether there are three, four, or
five moults in the migratory locust.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a> It is not improbable that, as is the case
with many other insects, the number of moults may vary according to the temperature
and food, variation in these agencies causing either retardation or
rapidity in development.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those with a complete metamorphosis are said to be <i>metabolous</i>
or <i>holometabolous</i>. (Lang.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>Leach<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> in 1815 gave the name of Ametabola to insects without, and Metabola
to insects with a metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>Latreille (1831) called insects with an incomplete metamorphosis <i>homotenous</i>
(which means similar to the end of life), and those with a complete metamorphosis,
<i>polymorphous</i>. For the different degrees of metamorphosis of insects he
employed two terms: for the incomplete degree, <i>metamorphosis dimidia</i>, and for
the total or pupal, <i>metamorphosis perfecta</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Westwood in his Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects (1839),
taking into account the relation of the larva with the imago, divided insects into
two divisions: the <i>Heteromorpha</i>, or those in which there is no resemblance
between the parent and its offspring, and <i>Homomorpha</i>, in which the larva
resembles the imago, except in the absence of wings.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>From the point of view of the degree of metamorphosis, insects
have been divided into <i>Heterometabola</i> and <i>Metabola</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. <i>Heterometabola.</i>—This group may be divided as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Manometabola</i>,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a> embracing those forms with a slight or gradual
metamorphosis, but which are active in all the stages, without any
resting stage. The orders passing through this degree of metamorphosis
are the following: Orthoptera, Dermaptera, Platyptera,
Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera (Coccidæ excepted).</p>

<p class='c007'>In all these groups, the only external differences of importance
between the freshly hatched nymph and the adult is the presence of
wings. The chief difference internally is the complete development
of the sexual glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be observed, however, that in the last nymph stage of
the Thysanoptera the articulations of the limbs are enveloped by a
membrane and the wings enclosed in short fixed sheaths; the
antennæ are turned back on the head, and the insect, though it
moves about, is much more sluggish than in the other state.
(Haliday.) Hence here we have a close approach to the following
degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Heremetabola</i>,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> including those forms with a gradual though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>slight or incomplete metamorphosis, but with a quiescent or resting
stage at the close of the nymph life. Lang has emphasized this
stage, calling attention to the fact that the fore legs of the nymph
of the 17–year Cicada, which lives underground on the roots of trees,
are thick and adapted for digging. The transition from the nymph
to the winged adult is signalized by the decided change in form of
the fore legs, as well as by the acquisition of the wings. “The last
larval stage is, then, what is called <i>quiescent</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the organization
of the imago develops within the chrysalis at the expense of the
accumulated reserve material.” (Lang.) There seems to be a
resting stage, when the insect does not perhaps suck the sap from
the roots, and awaits in its chamber its approaching change to the
imago; but we should scarcely apply the term <i>pupa</i> to this stage,
though the antennæ of the freshly hatched larva are larger and
longer than in the fully grown nymph and are distinctly 8–jointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Hemimetabola.</i>—In this division, so named by Brauer, the
changes are more marked, though there is no truly inactive pupa-like
stage. The orders are Perlaria (Plecoptera), Odonata, and
Plectoptera (Ephemeridæ). The freshly hatched nymphs of these
three groups are much alike in shape, that of Perlidæ, and indeed
most of the Platyptera, being more generalized, unless we except
that of Chloëon; all closely recall Campodea, and are therefore in
the Campodea-stage. These nymphs are indeed more generalized
than the freshly hatched nymph of Blattidæ, or any other of the
orders mentioned except the Platyptera, to which perlids belong.
They all have feet, and the body is more or less flattened. (Fig. 560.)</p>

<p class='c007'>II. <i>Holometabola.</i>—In this division we have for the first time a
true larva, and a pupa stage as distinguished from the imago. Moreover,
the insect at each stage is distinguished by radical differences
in form, surroundings, and in the nature of the food, while the pupa
is inactive, usually immovable, and incapable of taking any food,
and is often protected by a cocoon spun by the larva. The holometabolous
orders are the Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Mecoptera, Trichoptera,
Lepidoptera, Siphonaptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we have among worms, echinoderms, and Crustacea certain exceptional
species in a metamorphic group whose metamorphosis is suppressed, their development
being direct, so there is in pterygote insects, though in a very much
less degree, cases of direct development. In the wingless cockroaches such as
Pseudoglomeris, etc., of the tribe of Periphæriides, in some of which, however,
the males are winged, and in the Hemiptera, occur wingless forms such as the
lice and bed-bug. The Mallophaga are all wingless, while certain Dermaptera
(Chelidura, Anisolabis) are also apterous. The absence of wings in such cases
is due to disuse from parasitism, or to a life under stones or in cracks and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>fissures, where the insects are driven to avoid their enemies, and hence do not
need wings. The growth of wings and consequently the development of a metamorphosis
is suppressed, so that, as Lang says, “in contrast to the original
ametabola of the Apterygota, we have here an <i>acquired ametabola</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is rare that, after the rudiments of wings have once appeared in the very
young, they should disappear in the late nymph stage; this is, however, said
by Walsh to be the case with the Ephemerid Bætisca (Fig. 440). This is a
case of retardation in an acquired ametabolesis.</p>

<h3 class='c002'>THE LARVA</h3>
<p class='c006'>The term <i>larva</i> is peculiarly applicable to the young of the
holometabolous orders. The name (Latin, <i>larva</i>, a mask) was first
given to the caterpillar because it was thought by the ancients to
mask the form of the perfect insect. Swammerdam supposed that
the larva contained within itself “the germ of the future butterfly,
enclosed in what will be the case of the pupa, which is itself included
in three or more skins, one over the other, that will successively
cover the larva.” What led to his conception of the nature
of these changes was probably his observations on the semitransparent
larva of the gnat, in which the body and limbs of the
pupa can be partially seen; for Weismann has shown that the great
Dutch observer’s belief that the pupal and imaginal skins were in
reality already concealed under that of the larva is partially founded
in fact. Swammerdam states: “I can point out in the larva all the
limbs of the future nymph, or Culex, concealed beneath the skin,”
and he also observed beneath the skin of the larvæ of bees, just
before pupating, the antennæ, mouth-parts, wings, and limbs of the
adult. But, as we shall see farther on, the discovery by Weismann
in the larva of the germs of the imago has completely changed our
notions as to the nature of metamorphosis, and revolutionized our
knowledge of the fundamental processes concerned in the change
from larva to pupa, and from pupa to imago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only are the larvæ of each order of insects characteristic in
form, so that the grub or larva of beetles is readily distinguished
from those of other orders, or the maggot of flies from the apodous
larva of wasps and bees, but within the limits of the larger orders
there is great diversity of larval forms, showing that they are the
result of adaptation to their surroundings. This is especially the
case with the larvæ of the Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and
Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, the larvæ of insects may be divided into two types,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span><i>Campodea-form</i>, or campodeoid, sometimes called thysanuriform,
and the <i>eruciform</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The Campodea-form type of larva</h4>

<p class='c016'>This is the most primitive and generalized type of larva (Fig. 560).
A Campodeoid larva is one nearest in general shape to Campodea,
the form which we have seen to be the nearest allied to the probable
ancestor of the insects, and it also resembles the nymphs of the
heterometabolous insects, before the appearance of their rudimentary
wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brauer, in 1869,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> first suggested that the larvæ of a great number
of insects may be traced back to Campodea and Iapyx. The Campodea-form
larva is active, with a more or less flattened body, well
developed mandibulate mouth-parts, and usually long legs. The
nearest approach to the form of Campodea is the freshly hatched
nymph of cockroaches (Blattidæ), Forficula, Perlidæ, Termitidæ,
Psocidæ, Embidæ, Ephemeridæ, Odonata, especially the more
generalized Agrionidæ, the nymphs of Hemiptera, the larvæ of
certain Neuroptera, the active pedate larvæ of the more generalized
Coleoptera, such as those of Carabidæ, Cicindelidæ, Dyticidæ, etc.,
and the first larva (instar) of Stylopidæ and Meloidæ (Fig. 560, <i>d</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>While the Campodea-shape is retained throughout nymphal life,
of the orders above mentioned the Neuroptera and Coleoptera alone
have a true resting pupal stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should also be observed that great changes in the form of
the nymph occur within the limits of the Orthoptera; the nymph
of all the families except that of the Blattidæ, evidently the most
generalized and primitive, being more or less specialized, while the
nymphs of the other orders all vary in degree of specialization and
modification. The process of adaptation once begun went on very
rapidly, as it has in many other orders of insects, as well as in
animals of other phyla.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The eruciform type of larva</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Brauer also sagaciously pointed out that “a larger part of the
most highly developed insects assume another larva form, which
appears not only as a later acquisition, through adaptation to certain
definite conditions, but also arises as such before our eyes.
The larvæ of Lepidoptera, of saw-flies, and Panorpidæ show the
form most distinctly, and I call this the caterpillar form
(<i>Raupenform</i>). That this is not the primitive form, but one later
acquired, we see illustrated in certain beetles. The larvæ of Meloë
and of Sitaris, in their fully grown conditions, possess the caterpillar
form, but the new-born larvæ of these genera show the
Campodea-form. The last form is lost as soon as the larva begins
its parasitic mode of life.... The larger part of the beetles, the
Neuroptera (in part), the bees and flies (the last with the most
degraded maggot form), possess larvæ of this second form.” In
1871 we adopted these views, giving the name <i>eruciform</i> to this type
of larvæ, and afterwards Lubbock adopted Brauer’s views. Brauer
considered that the eruciform larva was the result of living a stationary
semi-parasitic life on plants, in carrion, or burrowing in the
trunks and branches or leaves and buds of trees, where they do not
have to move about in search of their food. The change from the
Campodea-form to the eruciform larva is a process of degeneration
and often of atrophy of the limbs, and, in the footless forms of
dipterous and hymenopterous insects, of the gnathites, accompanied
by a tendency of the body to become more or less cylindrical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first steps in the origination of the eruciform larva were
apparently taken in the order Neuroptera, as restricted by Brauer
and by myself, where, though the larvæ are campodeoid, there
is a true resting pupal stage. The most generalized larval form is
perhaps that of the Sialidæ (Fig. 560, <i>l</i>), in which the body tends to be
slightly cylindrical, though the legs are long, and the gnathites well
developed for seizing and biting their living prey. The terrestrial
larvæ of the Hemerobiidæ, though modifications of the sialid larval
form, are considerably specialized in adaptation to their active carnivorous
habits. But the life-history of Mantispa, where there are
two larval stages, gives us plainly enough the key to the mode in
which the complete metamorphosis was brought about. The larva,
born a true Campodea-like form, with large, long, 4–jointed legs, has
a structure which would enable it to move about freely after its
prey, beginning at once to live a sedentary life in the egg-sac of a
spider; before the first moult it loses the use of its legs, while the
antennæ are partly aborted. The result is that, owing to this
change of habits and surroundings from those of its active ancestors,
it changes its form, and the fully grown larva becomes cylindrical,
with small slender legs, and, owing to the partial disuse of its jaws,
acquires a small, round head.</p>

but retrograding and becoming vestigial, the body meanwhile
becoming fat and cylindrical, an apparent acceleration of growth
goes on within, with probably an enlargement of the intestine and
fat-body, and thus the pupal form is perfected while the larva is
full-fed and quiescent. It is not improbable that in the primitive
neuropteron, as the result of a mode of life like that of Mantispa,
the quiescent life of the later stages graduated into a quiescent,
inactive pupal life, allowing the changes going on in the internal
organs to result in a complete metamorphosis, which was transmitted
to the later Neuroptera, thus making the complete metamorphosis
a fixed, normal condition. It thus appears that a change of habits
and of food, and more especially the fact that the nymph became so
surrounded with an abundance of food close at hand that it did not
have to run actively about and seize it in a haphazard manner, were
the factors bringing about a change from the Campodea-form nymph
to the eruciform larva, thus inducing a hypermetamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larvæ of the Mecoptera (Panorpidæ, Fig. 562, <i>b</i>) are still more
caterpillar-like, and besides their cylindrical body, rounded head,
small short gnathites, small thoracic legs, they have what appear
to be 2–jointed legs to each of the nine abdominal segments, and
the close resemblance to caterpillars is farther carried out by the
presence of a pair of prothoracic spiracles, none existing on the
other two thoracic segments.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>In the Meloidæ (Fig. 560, <i>d</i>) and Stylopidæ the first larval stage
is Campodea-form; the changes will be described in the subsequent
section on Hypermetamorphosis, and while these cases of
change from a campodeoid to an inactive eruciform larva are very
salient, if we compare the graduated series of larval forms throughout
the order of Coleoptera, as represented by the illustrations in
Fig. 561, we shall see that in nearly, if not each, case the form of
the boring or mining, or bark or bud or seed-inhabiting grub is the
result of a change of habit and commissariat from active predaceous
larvæ, like those of the Carabidæ and other adephagous families,
together with those of the Staphylinidæ, with their flat body, big
mandibles, and well-developed maxillæ, to the cylindrical bodies of
such larvæ as those of Dermestes and Anthrenus, which live a more
sedentary life, to the root-feeding wire-worm or elaterid larvæ, and
scarabæid grubs, onward to the phytophagous Chrysomelidæ, with the
mining and boring buprestids and cerambycids,—in all these forms
we see a gradual atrophy of the legs, which is fully carried out in
the vermiform or maggot-like larva of the weevils. These changes
throughout the members of the entire order are epitomized in the
life-history of the Meloidæ, in which there are three typical forms
of larva: the Campodea-form (triungulin stage), eruciform (second
or carabidoid stage), and vermiform (coarctate) larva.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Lepidoptera the eruciform, pedate type is adhered to
throughout the order, with the rare exception of the nearly apodous
mining larva of Prodoxus (Fig. 563, <i>a</i>), Phyllocnistis,
and Nepticula, which have no thoracic
legs, and the limacodid larvæ, whose abdominal
legs are totally aborted, while the thoracic ones
are much reduced (Fig. 564).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Hymenoptera the phytophagous forms
are eruciform, while by the agency of the same
factors as already mentioned, <i>i.e.</i> a sedentary or parasitic life and
abundance of food within constant reach, the larvæ lose their legs
and become vermiform.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>In the Diptera, which are the most highly specialized of insects,
the maggot or vermiform shape, and absence of any legs, prevails
throughout the order, though the eucephalous larvæ show their
origin from a primitive eruciform type of larva. The highly
specialized larvæ of the Culicidæ and Simuliidae are undoubtedly
related to the earliest and most generalized types, while the maggots
of the parasitic flies (Tachinidæ) and other muscids are later degradational
forms, and the result of adaptation induced, as in the
previous cases, by a sedentary or parasitic mode of life, living
as they do immersed in an abundance of rich nitrogenous food,
with the result that the mouth-parts have become atrophied by
disuse, while the limbs have become entirely aborted, though the
thoracic imaginal discs develop normally in the embryonic or pre-larval
stages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears, therefore, highly probable that the metamorphoses
of insects are the result of the action of change of conditions, just
as the polymorphism of Termites is with little doubt the result of
differences of food and other conditions. These matters will be
farther discussed under the head of Causes of Metamorphosis.</p>

  <h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> Growth and increase in size of the larva</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The rapidity of growth and enormous increase in size in early
life is especially noticeable in caterpillars and other phytophagous
larvæ. The latest observations are those of Trouvelot on <i>Telea
polyphemus</i>. When this silkworm hatches, it weighs <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>20</span></span> of a grain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When,” he says “a worm is 30 days old, it will have consumed
about 90 grains of food; but when 56 days old, it is fully grown and
has consumed not less than 120 oak leaves, weighing ¾ of a pound;
besides this it has drank not less than ½ an ounce of water. So the
food taken by a single silkworm in 56 days equals in weight 86,000
times the primitive weight of the worm. Of this about ¼ of a
pound becomes excrementitious matter, 207 grains are assimilated,
and over 5 ounces have evaporated.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Dandolo stated that the Asiatic silkworm (<i>Bombyx mori</i>) weighs on hatching
not over <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>100</span></span> of a grain, but when fully grown about 95 grains. During this
period, therefore, it has increased 9500 times its original weight, and has eaten
60,000 times its weight of food. Newport thought this estimate of the amount
of food was a little too great. But comparing it with Trouvelot’s estimate for
the American silkworm, which weighs when hatched five times as much, it
would not appear to be so. Newport found that the larva of <i>Sphinx ligustri</i> at
the moment of leaving the egg weighs about <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>80</span></span> of a grain, and when fully fed
125 grains, so that in the course of 32 days it increases about 9976 times its
original weight. This proportion of increase is exceeded by the larva of <i>Cossus
ligniperda</i>, which, boring in the trunks of trees, remains about three years in
the larva state, and increases, according to Lyonet, to the amount of 72,000
times its first weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Newport adds that those larvæ in which the proportion of increase is the
greatest, are usually those which remain longest in the pupa state, as in the
silkworm. “Thus Redi observed in the maggots of the common flesh-flies a
rate of increase amounting to about 200 times the original weight in 24 hours,
but the proportion of increase in these larvæ does not at all approach that of
the Sphinx and Cossus.” From his observations on the larva of one of the
wild bees (<i>Anthophora retusa</i>) Newport believes that this is also the case with
the Hymenoptera. The weight of the egg of this insect is about <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>150</span></span> of a grain,
and the average of a full-grown larva 6<span class='fraction'>8<br /><span class='vincula'>10</span></span> grains, so that its increase is about
1020 times its original weight; “which compared with that of the Sphinx of
medium size, is but as 1 to 9¾, and to a Sphinx of maximum size only as 1 to
a little more than 11.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>The growth is most rapid after the last moult. “Thus a larva of <i>Sphinx
ligustri</i>, which at its last change weighed only about 19 to 20 grains, at the expiration
of eight days, when it was fully grown, weighed nearly 120 grains.”
(Newport.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>d.</i> The process of moulting (ecdysis)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Insects periodically shed the exoskeleton, together with the chitinous
lining of their internal organs of ectodermal origin, which
thus sloughed off are called the <i>exuvia</i>. The process in the locust
has been described by Riley.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> It occupies from half to three-quarters
of an hour (Fig. 565). This process has naturally, from
the ease with which it can be observed, been most frequently
examined in the Lepidoptera, though careful and detailed observations
of the inner and outer changes are still greatly needed, especially
in other orders. In the caterpillar of most moths, especially
one of the more generalized bombycine moths, on slipping out of
its egg-shell the head is of enormous size as compared with the body,
but the latter soon fills out after the creature has eaten a few hours;
the head, of course, does not during this time increase in size, and
the larvæ of different instars may be exactly distinguished, as Dyar
has shown, by the measurements of the head.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before the caterpillar moults, it stops feeding, and the head is
now small compared with the body; the head of the second instar
is now large, situated partly under the much-swollen prothoracic
segment, and pushes the head of the first instar forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Newport has well described the mode of shedding the skin in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span><i>Sphinx ligustri</i>, and his detailed description will apply to most
lepidopterous larvæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole body is wrinkled and contracted in length, and there are occasionally
powerful contractions and twitchings of its entire body; the skin becomes
dry and shrivelled, and is gradually separated from the new and very delicate
one of the next instar beneath. After several powerful efforts of the larva the
old skin cracks along the middle of the dorsal surface of the mesothoracic segment,
and by repeated efforts the fissure is extended into the 1st and 3d segment,
while the covering of the head divides along the vertex and on each
side of the clypeus. “The larva then gradually presses itself through the opening,
withdrawing first its head and thoracic legs, and subsequently the remainder
of its body, slipping off the skin from behind like the finger of a glove. This
process, after the skin has once been ruptured, seldom lasts more than a few
minutes. When first changed the larva is exceedingly delicate, and its head,
which does not increase in size until it again changes its skin, is very large in
proportion to the rest of the body.” (Art. Insecta, etc.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Trouvelot’s account is more detailed and an advance on that of Newport’s
view. He explicitly states, and we know that he was a very close observer,
that the old skin is detached by “a fluid which circulates between it and the
worm.” His account is as follows: The polyphemus worm, like all other silkworms,
changes its skin five times during its larval life. The moulting takes
place at regular periods, which comes around about every 10 days for the first
four moultings, while about 20 days elapse between the fourth and fifth moulting.
The worm ceases to eat for a day before moulting, and spins some silk
on the vein of the under surface of a leaf; it then secures the hooks of its
hind legs in the texture it has thus spun, and there remains motionless; soon
after, through the transparency of the skin of the neck, can be seen a second
head larger than the first, belonging to the larva within. The moulting generally
takes place after four o’clock in the afternoon; a little before this time the
worm holds its body erect, grasping the leaf with the two pairs of hind legs
only; the skin is wrinkled and detached from the body by a fluid which circulates
between it and the worm; two longitudinal bands are seen on each side,
produced by a portion of the lining of the spiracles, which at this moment have
been partly detached; meanwhile the contractions of the worm are very energetic,
and by them the skin is pulled off and pushed towards the posterior part;
the skin thus becomes so extended that it soon tears just under the neck, and
then from the head. When this is accomplished the most difficult operation is
over, and now the process of moulting goes on very rapidly. By repeated contractions
the skin is folded towards the tail, like a glove when taken off, and the
lining of the spiracles comes out in long white filaments. When about one-half
of the body appears, the shell still remains like a cap, enclosing the jaws;
then the worm, as if reminded of this loose skull-cap, removes it by rubbing it
on a leaf; this done, the worm finally crawls out of its skin, which is attached
to the fastening made for the purpose. Once out of its old skin, the worm makes
a careful review of the operation, with its head feeling the aperture of every
spiracle, as well as the tail, probably for the purpose of removing any broken
fragment of skin which might have remained in these delicate organs. Not only
is the outer skin cast off, but also the lining of the air-tubes and intestines, together
with all the chewing organs and other appendages of the head. After
the moulting, the size of the larva is considerably increased, the head is large
compared with the body, but 8 or 10 days later it will look small, as the body
will have increased very much in size. This is a certain indication that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>worm is about to moult. Every 10 days the same operation is repeated. From
the fourth moulting to the time of beginning the cocoon the period is about
16 days. (Amer. Naturalist, i, pp. 37, 38.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Little has been recorded as to the exact mode of casting the larval skin in
Coleoptera. Slingerland states that <i>Euphoria inda</i> when pupating sheds the
larval skin off the anal end in the same way as in caterpillars, while in <i>Pelidnota
punctata</i> the larval skin splits down the whole length of the back, retains the
larval shape, and forms a covering for the pupa which remains inside. (Can.
Entomologist, xxix, p. 52.) The old larval skin in the Coccinellidæ and certain
Chrysomelidæ is retained crumpled up at the end of the body, while in Dermestes,
Anthrenus, etc., it cloaks the pupa.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not only is the integument, with its hairs, setæ, and other armatures, as well
as the cornea or facets of the eyes, shed, but also all the lining or intima of
those internal organs which have been originally derived by an ingrowth or
invagination of the ectoderm are likewise cast off, with the probable exception,
of course, of the mid-intestine, which is endodermal in its origin. Even so early
an observer as Swammerdam noticed that the internal lining of the alimentary
canal comes away with the skin. He states that the larva of <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>
sheds both the lining of the colon, and of the smaller as well as the larger
branches of the tracheæ.</p>

<p class='c013'>Careful observations are still needed on the internal changes at ecdysis of
most insects. Newport seems to have observed more closely than any one else,
notwithstanding the great number who have reared caterpillars but have not
carefully observed these points, the extent of the process internally. He informs
us: “The lining of the mouth and pharynx, with that of the mandibles, is
detached with the covering of the head, and that of the large intestines with
the skin of the posterior part of the body, and besides these also the lining of the
tracheal tubes. The lining of the stomach itself, or the portion of the alimentary
canal which extends from the termination of the œsophagus to the insertion of
the so-called biliary vessels, is also detached, and becomes completely disintegrated,
and appears to constitute part of the <i>meconium</i> voided by the insect on
assuming its imago state.” (Art. Insecta, p. 876.) Newport states on another
occasion that he had “noticed the remarkable circumstance [now explained
by the fact that the mid-intestine is of endodermal origin] that the mucous
lining of the true ventriculus was not cast off with the rest, but was discharged
with the fecula.”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Burmeister also observed that the smaller tracheæ as well
as the internal tunic of the colon of Libellulæ are shed.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the apodous larvæ of Hymenoptera which live in cells, as we have observed
in those of Bombus, during the process of moulting, the delicate skin breaks
away in shreds, probably owing to the tension due to the unequal growth of the
different parts of the body. “Thus after the skin beneath has fully formed,
shreds of the former skin remain about the mouth-parts, the spiracles, and anus.
Upon pulling upon these, the lining of the alimentary tube and tracheæ can be
drawn out, sometimes, in the former case, to the length of several lines.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a> We
then added, “As all these internal systems of vessels are destined to change
their form in the pupa, it may be laid down as a rule in the moulting of insects
and Crustacea, that the lining of the internal organs, which is simply a continuation
of the outer tegument, or arthroderm, is, in the process of moulting,
sloughed off with that outer integument.” We have satisfied ourself that in
the larvæ of the Lepidoptera (<i>e.g.</i> Datana) the tracheæ at the time of ecdysis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>undergo a complete histolysis, and arise <i>de novo</i> from hypodermal cells, the so-called
spiral threads originating from elongated peritracheal nuclei. (See p. 449,
Fig. 412.) This is undoubtedly also the case with the salivary ducts, which are
strengthened and rendered elastic by tænidia like those of tracheæ. As the
urinary tubes are diverticula of the proctodæum, itself an ectodermal invagination,
they may also, though not lined with a chitinous intima, be renewed. With
little doubt the intima of the ducts of poison, spinning, and most, if not all the
other glands, though certainly the dermal glands, is exuviated. We have found
that the lobster in moulting sheds, besides the skin with the most delicate setæ,
the lining of the proventriculus, and the apodemes of the head and thorax, hence
it is most probable that the tentorium of the head of insects as well as the apodemes
and phragmas of the thorax are exuviated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The formation of the inner skin, or that of any succeeding stage
(instar), is due to the secretion of the structureless chitinous layer
by the cells of the hypodermis, during the process of histogenesis.
These cells at this time are very active, and the formation of the
new layer of chitin arrests the supply of nourishment to the old
skin, so that it dries, hardens, and with the aid of the fluid thrown
out at this time separates from the new chitinous layer secreted by
the hypodermis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mention of this fluid, which Newport was the first to observe, and which he
says causes the separation of the old from the underlying fresh integument of
the caterpillar, recalls a passage in Hatchett-Jackson’s Studies in the morphology
of the Lepidoptera, which we quote on a succeeding page, where he calls attention
to the formation of such a liquid, which in the reptiles facilitates the process
of moulting, adding, “Whether such is the case with the moult of the caterpillar,
I do not know.” Is it not also possible that the growth of the setæ or
tubercles on the cuticle of the caterpillar may likewise serve to loosen and
detach the overlying skin about to be cast off? After writing the foregoing, we
find that Miall and Denny have suggested that the setæ of the cockroach probably
serve the same purpose as the casting-hairs of the crayfish and reptiles.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is well known that in the crayfish and in lizards the skin is first loosened
by the growth of temporary hairs or setæ, which locally grow inward from the
old cuticle and push the skin away when it is shuffled off by the movements of
the body, jaws, and limbs, as well as the body in general.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such spines arise in the pupa of many insects, for Verhoeff finds
that the spines and teeth of pupal fossorial and other Hymenoptera,
as well as Coleoptera, function as moulting-processes for loosening
and pushing off the last larval skin, rather than for locomotion. He
also claims that the spines of the pupa of the dipterous Anthrax are
both for locomotion and for boring, especially the spines on the head
and tail. He therefore divides these pupal spines into helcodermatous
(boring or tearing) and locomotor spines.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>Gonin has fully confirmed Newport’s discovery of the exuvial
fluid. He states that during pupation the outside of the pupa, especially
the parts of the head and thorax “is coated with a viscous
liquid secreted by special glands.” The parts only harden subsequent
to pupation after exposure to the air (p. 41). His observations
were made under the direction of Professor Bugnion, who
kindly writes us:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“M. Gonin has proved the formation of a liquid which passes under the
cuticle at the time of the last moult and facilitates exuviation. We think that
this liquid is secreted by large cells (unicellular glands) which we see especially
on the surface of segments 1–3. These cells form part of the hypodermis, and
their pores open under the cuticle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a subsequent letter enclosing a sketch kindly made for me by M. Gonin
(Fig. 566), Professor Bugnion writes me Aug. 24, 1897, regarding the functions
of the large hypodermal cells (<i>l. hy</i>), as follows: “It seems to me, in fact,
after having again examined the sections, that the function of these cells is
not sufficiently elucidated. Indeed these cells occur only in the section passing
through the 1st segment, between the head and 1st thoracic segment. It would
seem, if these cells supply the liquid which lubricates the surface at the time
of ecdysis, that they should be spread over the entire surface of the body. Moreover,
these cells have no distinct orifice, and although there is seen at times to
issue streams of a substance (coagulated by the reagents), they cannot be compared
with true unicellular glands like those of the epidermis of fishes, amphibians,
etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the other hand, if it is the blood which oozes out on the surface (according
to your hypothesis), it would seem that the loss of blood would cause the
death of the larva. I believe then it is due to the secretion of the hypodermis
which spreads over the whole surface when the cells are still soft (not yet hardened
from contact with the air). At all events, there is a liquid spread over the
surface; it is this liquid which glues the wings and the legs to the body at the
moment the caterpillar issues from the rent in its skin. If at this instant we
plunge the pupa in the water the liquid is dissolved, and the feet, wings, etc.,
are not glued to the body.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. T. A. Chapman also writes us: “There is no question about the existence
of a fluid between the two skins at moulting. In hairy larvae the hairs
are always wet at first, or if the skin be renewed rather more quickly than the
larva does it naturally, the wetness of both surfaces is obvious. I do not know
the nature of the fluid, but it is related to that which hardens into the dense
pupal case, and also hardens in a less degree the skin of the larva. I suppose
it must contain some chitin in a soluble form. If a newly cast larva skin be
taken, there is no difficulty in extending the shrivelled mass to its full length
and dimensions, but if a short time elapses, this chitin hardens, and the skin

I have tried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been stated that there is a subimaginal pellicle in Lepidoptera,
but as Dr. Chapman writes me, “what has been observed has
been some of the inner pupal dissepiments, such as the pupal cases
of the under wings,” etc. They may be observed in the head of the
tineid pupæ, and other small moths. We have thought that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>delicate, purplish, powdery layer left in the cast shells of the pupæ
of saturnians, Catocalæ, and other moths, might possibly be such a
pellicle, but this view has been dispelled by the following statement
of Professor Bugnion in a letter answering an inquiry whether he
had noticed such a pellicle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A liquid which is secreted in a few minutes at the time of the last moult,
forms in drying a yellowish layer spotted with black (in <i>Pieris brassicæ</i>). This
layer extends around the entire pupa, and serves both to protect it and to glue
together the wings, legs, etc., in their new position. The dried liquid on the
surface of the pupa, and by means of which the appendages are glued to the
surface, very likely corresponds to the pellicle of which you speak.” The newly
exposed integument is at first pale and colorless, but soon assumes the hues
peculiar to the species, and the insect, at first exhausted, after a short rest
becomes active.</p>

<p class='c013'>E. Howgate has noticed under the microscope peculiar internal movements
in a small immature transparent geometrid while moulting. “Each separate
segment,” he says, “commencing at the head, elongated within the outer skin,
whilst the next ones remained in their former state. Each segment in its turn
behaved in this curious manner until the last was reached, when the motion
was reversed and proceeded toward the head, when it was again reversed....
The whole proceeding appeared as if the larva was gliding within itself, segment
after segment, the outer skin remaining as if held by the other segments, whilst
the particular one in motion freed itself within. After remaining motionless
for a short interval, the skin near the head swelled and burst, open at the back....
Presently out comes the head of the new caterpillar, pushing forward the
old one.... After a short struggle the new true legs appear, pushing off and
treading under foot the old ones. Then by violent wriggling movements the
abdominal legs were extricated. Then all is clear, and the larva, which is quite
exhausted, coils itself up and literally pants for breath.” (The Naturalist,
November, 1885, No. 124, p. 366, quoted in Psyche, iv, p. 327, 1887.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the worms and most other ametabolous invertebrates are not known to
moult their integument, the body steadily increasing in size without frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>changes of skin, it seems that growth may go on and still be accompanied by
considerable changes in shape of the body without change of skin. Frequent
ecdyses appear, then, to be the result of the great and sudden changes of the
body, necessitated by the adaptation of the animal to new or unusual conditions
of life. In young Daphnia, a cladocerous crustacean, as many as eight moults
were observed in a period of 17 days, and spiders frequently moult even after
reaching their full size. The swollen bodies of the gravid female of Gastrophysa,
Meloë, or of Termites, and of the honey ant show that the skin can stretch to
a great extent, but in the metamorphoses of Crustacea and of insects, whose
young are more or less worm-like or generalized in form, with fewer segments
and appendages, or with appendages adapted for quite different uses from
those of mature life, the necessity for a change of skin is seen to be necessary
for mechanical reasons. Hence Crustacea and insects moult most frequently
early in life, when the changes of form are most thoroughgoing and radical, while
simple growth and increase in size are most rapid at the end of larval life, as seen
both in shrimps and crabs, and in insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>The hibernating caterpillars of certain butterflies are known to moult once
oftener than those of the summer brood. Mr. W. H. Edwards has discussed the
subject with much detail. “There seems,” he says, “to be a necessity with
the hibernators of getting rid of the rigid skin in which the larva has passed the
winter; that is, if the hibernation has taken place during the middle stages,
as it does in Apatura and Limenitis. In these cases very little food is taken
between the moult which precedes hibernation and the one which follows it,
and the larva while in lethargy is actually smaller than before the next previous
moult. The skin shrinks, and has to be cast off before the awakened larva can
grow. Those species (observed) whose larva moults five times in the winter
brood require but four moults during the summer.” He adds that while the
larva is in lethargy, it is actually smaller than before the next previous moult.
Dr. Dyar writes: “I think there is no doubt about the number of stages of
arctian larvæ. They seem to have a great capacity of spinning out their life-history
by interpolated stages (as regards width of head). I think it is because
so many of them hibernate, and only a single brood extends throughout the
season.” (Psyche iii, p. 161.)</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, it is difficult to understand why the caterpillars of arctians
moult so frequently, nearly twice as often as in most other caterpillars, though
the changes of form and armature are so slight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Chapman also writes me: “Arctians resemble bears (Arctos), polar and
others, in having long hairs to protect them during winter, and are, in fact, typically
hibernators. Many of them have to half-hibernate, having warmth enough
to keep them awake, but not enough food for growth, but their tissues, at least
the chitinous ones of the cutis, and also probably, and perhaps especially, of the
alimentary canal, become old and effete, and require the rejuvenescence acquired
by a moult. Other smooth-skinned hibernators have similar capabilities.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Chapman has shown in his paper on Acronycta that these caterpillars of this
genus illustrate how larvæ may lose a moult, and they do so to acquire a sudden
change of plumage.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The number of moults in insects of different orders.</b>—It will be seen
from the data here presented that the number of moults is as a
rule greatest in holometabolic insects with the longest lives, and
that an excessive number of ecdyses may at times be due to some
physical cause, such as lack of food combined with low temperature.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>In Campodea there is a single fragmentary moult (Grassi), while
the Collembola (<i>Macrotoma plumbea</i>) shed their skin throughout
life. (Sommer.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the winged insects, especially Lepidoptera, the number of
moults is dependent on climate. Insects of wide distribution growing
faster in warmer climates consequently shed their skins oftener;
for example, the same species may moult once oftener in the southern
than in the northern States, as in the case of <i>Callosamia promethea</i>,
which in West Virginia is double-brooded. Hibernating larvæ moult
once oftener than those of the summer brood. (W. H. Edwards.)
Weniger by rearing the larvæ of <i>Antheræa mylitta</i> and <i>Eacles imperialis</i>,
and which, when reared under normal conditions, actually
have six stages, found that when reared in a warm moist atmosphere
of about 25° C. they have but five stages, <i>i.e.</i> moult but four times. In
the hot and moist climate of Ceylon, <i>A. mylitta</i> has but five stages.
(Psyche, v, p. 28.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Orthoptera Acrydians moult five times; <i>Diapheromera
femorata</i> but twice (Riley); a katydid (<i>Microcentrum retinervis</i>)
moults four times (Comstock). <i>Mantis religiosa</i>, according to Pagenstecher,
moults seven times, having eight stages, including that before
the amnion is cast, but the first “moult” being an exuviation
of the amnion, the number of stages is seven. Cockroaches (<i>Periplaneta
americana</i>) are said by Marlatt to “pass through a variable
number of moults, there being sometimes as many as seven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Homoptera there are, in general, from two to four moults;
thus in Typhlocyba there are five stages, and in Aphis at least three,
and in Psylla four during the nymphal state. Psocus has four.
Riley states that the nymph of the female coccid, <i>Icerya purchasi</i>,
sheds its skin three times, and that of the male twice. Notwithstanding
its slow growth, Riley says, the 17–year Cicada moults
oftener than once a year, and the number of larval stages probably
amounts to 25 or 30 in all. The bed-bug sheds its skin five times;
and with the last moult appear the minute wing-pads characteristic
of the adult. In <i>Conorhinus sanguisuga</i> there are “at least two larval
stages and pupal stages.” (Marlatt.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dragon-flies moulting occurs, Calvert thinks, many times,
since the rudiments of wings are said by Poletaiew to only appear
in odonate nymphs after the third or fourth moult.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the May-fly, Chloëon, the number of ecdyses is 20. The neuropterous
<i>Ascalaphus</i> (Helecomitus) <i>insimulans</i> of Ceylon moults
three times before pupating. Among the Mecoptera Felt has shown
that <i>Panorpa rufescens</i> moults seven times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>In Coleoptera the normal or usual number is not definitely known;
Meloë moults five times, but this is a hypermetamorphic insect;
<i>Tribolium confusum</i> has been carried by Mr. Chittenden through
seven moults. <i>Phytonomus punctatus</i>, the clover-leaf weevil, moults
three times, according to Riley, who has observed that <i>Dermestes
vulpinus</i> passes through seven larval stages.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the breeding jars, with plenty of food and a constant temperature of from
68° to 78° F., the larvæ cast their 1st skin in from four to nine days, the great
majority moulting at seven days. Under the same conditions the 2d skin was
cast at from four to seven days, the majority moulting at six days; the 3d skin
at from three to six days, the majority moulting at five days; and the 4th skin
at from three to six days, the majority moulting at five days; the 5th skin at
from five to seven days, and the 6th skin at six days. There are thus seven
larval stages. (Report for 1885, p. 260.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Riley has ascertained that by rearing isolated larvæ of <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>, one
after being kept nearly a year had moulted 11 times, when it died. A second
larva, hatched June 5, had moulted 12 times by June 10 of the following year,
(1877), when it also died. Of <i>T. obscurus</i> three larvæ were reared to the imago
state. One moulted 11 times by Aug. 30 of the same year, pupated Jan. 20, 1877,
and finally became a beetle Feb. 7, 1877. The other two both moulted 12 times,
and reached the imago stage Feb. 18 and March 9, respectively. “All were, as
nearly as possible, under like conditions of food and surroundings, and in all
cases the moult that gave the pupa is not considered among the larval moults.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Two larvæ of the museum pest (<i>Trogoderma tarsale</i>) were kept by Riley in a
tight tin box with an old silkworm cocoon. “They were half-grown when
placed in the box. On Nov. 8, 1880, there were in the box 28 larva skins, all
very much of a size, the larva having apparently grown but little. The skins
were removed and the box closed again as tightly as possible. Recently, or after
a lapse of two years, the box was again opened and we found one of the larvæ
dead and shrivelled up; but the other was living and apparently not changed in
appearance. There were 15 larva skins in the box. He could not tell when
the one larva died, but it is certain that within a little more than three and a
half years, two larvæ shed not less than 43 skins, and that one larva did not,
during that time, appreciably increase in size. We know of no observations
which indicate the normal or average length of life, or number of moults in
either Tenebrio or Trogoderma, but it is safe to assume from what is known,
in these respects, of allied species, that in both the instances here referred to, but
particularly in the case of Trogoderma, development was retarded by insufficient
nutrition, and that the frequent moulting and slow growth resulted therefrom,
and were correlated.”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> Further observations such as these are greatly needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the Siphonaptera the common cat and dog flea (<i>Pulex serraticeps</i>)
moults three times before pupating. (Howard.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In Lepidoptera the usual or average number of moults is four,
but the number varies considerably, the greatest number yet known
occurring in <i>Phyrrarctia isabella</i>, which, Dr. Dyar informs me, moults
10 times.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Dyar’s observations it appears that there are usually five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>larval stages, but six and seven stages are not infrequent, while
there are seven in <i>Seirarctia echo</i>, eight in <i>Ecpantheria scribonia</i>,
Scepis, and Apatelodes, and nine and ten in arctians, while the
European <i>Nola centonalis</i> moults nine times, other species of this
genus shedding their skins six times. (Buckler.) (Psyche, v,
pp. 420–422.) <i>Callosamia promethea</i> appears, as a rule, to moult
but three times. <i>Orgyia antiqua</i> was found by Hellins to moult
from three to five times. Riley found that in <i>O. leucostigma</i> the
males moult four times, the female four, but sometimes five times,
while Dyar states that in <i>O. gulosa</i> the male larvæ moult three or
four times, the female always four times; in <i>O. antiqua</i>, however,
there are six stages, and in the female seven. Lithocolletis, Chambers
thinks, as a rule, moults eight times, and Comstock thinks that
<i>L. hamadryadella</i> casts its skin seven or eight times.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the blow-fly (Calliphora) Leuckart and Weismann have inferred
at least two moults, while Weismann suspected that there are as
many as four. In <i>Musca domestica</i> we have observed that the
larva moults three times; in Œstridæ there are three larval stadia.
(Brauer.) In Corethra there are four larval moults, and Miall
thinks there are probably as many in Chironomus. Passing to the
phytophagous Hymenoptera, there are three moults or four larval
stages in <i>Nematus erichsonii</i>, but Dyar informs us that less than
four stages in saw-fly larvæ is very rare, that he has only one record
of less than five, and that that is doubtful; “five for nematid, six
and seven for others, is certainly the rule. The highest I have is
the indication of 11 stages for <i>Harpiphorus varianus</i>, but this again
is an inference only, and attended with doubt.” (Can. Ent., xxvii,
p. 208.) In Bombus we have observed five different sizes of larvæ,
and hence suppose the least number of ecdyses is five, while we are
disposed to believe that this insect, as well as wasps and bees, in
general shed their skins as many as eight times during their entire
existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The honey-bee, Cheshire thinks, since he has found the old and
ruptured pellicles, probably moults six times before it spins its
cocoon, or passes into the semipupa condition. (Bees and Bee-keeping,
p. 20.)</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the cause of the great number of moults in the arctians and
in the beetles experimented with by Riley, it would seem that cold
and the lack of food during hibernation were the agents in arctians,
and starvation or the lack of food in the case of the beetles, such
cause preventing growth, though the hypodermis-cells retained their
activity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span><b>Reproduction of lost limbs.</b>—Here might be discussed the subject
of the renovation or renewal of maimed or lost limbs, or the
reparation of other injuries. As is well known, the cœlenterates,
echinoderms, and worms under certain circumstances multiply by
self-division, or if artificially mutilated, the parts are gradually
restored by cell-proliferation or histogenesis. It is so with the
antennæ and legs of crustaceans as well as the digits and tail of
salamanders. The experiments first made by Le Pelletier<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> on spiders,
and later by Heineken,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and others after him, on different spiders,
as well as on Orthoptera and Hemiptera (Blatta, Reduvius, etc.), have
proved that antennæ and legs and other external parts which have
been injured or shortened, or entirely cut off in young individuals,
are replaced at the next, or after successive moults, though generally
in diminished size. This does not usually occur in adult life, and
the process of reparation of lost parts is apparently due to the
active growth of the cells of the parts affected during the process
of moulting, when the histolysis of the maimed or diseased parts
is succeeded by the rapid development of new cells, not only of the
hypodermis, but also of the more specialized tissues within. And
this tends to prove that such histolysis and making over of the
muscles and other structures within occur especially in all metamorphic
insects, and also in ametabolous forms, though the process
has been most thoroughly examined in the Diptera, where these
changes are more marked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gonin has found that the thoracic legs of the caterpillar correspond
only to the tarsi of the imago (Fig. 608). It results, he
says, from this fact that in accordance with the observations of
Réaumur (which were wrongly interpreted by Newport and Künckel
D’Herculais) that the amputation of the legs of the larva does not
involve the entire leg, but only the extremity of the leg of the imago.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the cocoon.</b>—While the larvæ of many insects, as those
of the butterflies, suspend themselves before transforming, and spin
no cocoon, or dig into the earth for protection and to secure an
immunity from too great changes of temperature, a large proportion
of the larvæ of metabolous insects which lead an inactive pupal life,
line their earthen cells with silk, or spin a more or less elaborate
case of silk, called the <i>cocoon</i>. We have seen that the inactive pupa
of the male scale-insects is covered by the scale itself, or even in
one case the insect forms a true cocoon of fibres of wax. The aquatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>larvæ of the Neuroptera and Coleoptera creep out of the water, and
by the movements of their bodies make a rude earthen cell in the
bank, while that of Donacia spins a dense, leathery
cocoon (Fig. 567) in the earth. The larvæ of the
Embiidæ are protected by a cocoon, which they
renew at each moult. Coniopteryx spins an orbicular
cocoon, the Hemerobiidæ a spherical, dense,
whitish one. The Trichoptera transform within
their larval cases, which thus serve as cocoons,
as do certain case-bearing Lepidoptera, notably the Psychidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pupa of certain leaf-eating beetles (Chrysomelidæ), as well as
the Coccinellidæ, Dermestidæ,
Hister, etc., are usually protected
by the cast larval skin, which is
retained, forming a rude shelter.
While many beetles spin an oval
cocoon (Gyrinus, Silphidæ), the
wood-boring species make one of
chips glued together, and that of
Lucanus, which feeds on decayed
wood, is lined with silk (Fig.
568). Anobium constructs a
silken cocoon, interweaving the fine particles of its thin castings;
the larvæ of weevils also usually spin silken cocoons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The larval skin of the coarctate Diptera is retained as a protection
for the soft-bodied pupa within, the old larval skin separating from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>the integument of the semipupa. To this cocoon-like covering of
the coarctate pupa we have restricted the term <i>puparium</i>, originally
used by Kirby and Spence to designate the pupa. The puparium
is usually cylindrical or barrel-shaped, rounded at each end.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the <i>Diptera cyclorhapha</i>, or common house and flesh flies, etc.,
the puparium remains in vital connection, by means of four tracheæ,
with the enclosed pupa, which escapes from the case through a
curved seam or lid at the anterior end
and not by a slit in the back, as do the
orthoraphous families, represented by the
horse-fly (Tabanidæ, Asilidæ, Fig. 570),
etc., where in some cases the obtected pupa
remains within the loose envelope formed
by the old larval skin, which Brauer calls
a false puparium. The dry, hard puparium
is burst open at the cephalic end when
the fly emerges, by means of the frontal
vesicle, which is distended with fluid (Fig.
571).</p>

<p class='c007'>The exact mode of spinning the cocoon by caterpillars has been
carefully observed by L. Trouvelot in the case of the polyphemus
silkworm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When fully grown, the worm, which has been devouring the leaves so voraciously,
becomes restless and crawls about the branches in search of a suitable
place to build up its cocoon; before this it is motionless for some time, holding
on to the twig with its front legs, while the two hind pair are detached; in this
position it remains for some time, evacuating the contents of the alimentary canal
until finally a gelatinous, transparent, very caustic fluid, looking like albumen,
or the white of an egg, is ejected; this is a preparation for the long catalepsy that
the worm is about to fall into. It now feels with its head in all directions, to
discover any leaves to which to attach the fibres that are to give form to the
cocoon. If it finds the place suitable, it begins to wind a layer of silk around a
twig, then a fibre is attached to a leaf near by, and by many times doubling this
fibre and making it shorter every time, the leaf is made to approach the twig at
the distance necessary to build the cocoon; two or three leaves are disposed like
this one, and then fibres are spread between them in all directions, and soon
the ovoid form of the cocoon distinctly appears. This seems to be the most
difficult feat for the worm to accomplish, as after this the work is simply mechanical,
the cocoon being made of regular layers of silk united by a gummy
substance. The silk is distributed in zigzag lines of about one-eighth of an inch
long. When the cocoon is made, the worm will have moved his head to and
fro, in order to distribute the silk, about 254,000 times.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After about half a day’s work, the cocoon is so far completed that the worm
can hardly be distinguished through the fine texture of the wall; then a gummy
resinous substance, sometimes of a light-brown color, is spread all over the inside
of the cocoon. The larva continues to work for four or five days, hardly taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>a few minutes of rest, and finally another coating is spun in the interior, when
the cocoon is all finished and completely air tight. The fibre diminishes in
thickness as the completion of the cocoon advances, so that the last internal
coating is not half so thick and so strong as the outside ones.” (Amer. Naturalist,
i, p. 86.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of spinning the cocoon of an ichneumon (Microgaster)
parasitic on Philampelus has been well described by John P. Marshall,
as follows:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id073'>
<img src='images/i_646.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 572.</span>—Microgaster larvæ; spinning their cocoons: <i>a</i>, enlarged view of 5.—After Marshall.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The first appearance of the parasite is represented in Fig. 572, <span class='small'>1</span>. A warty
excrescence appears on the back of the caterpillar, which slowly emerges until
it is seen to be a larva enclosed in a delicate transparent membrane, as represented
in <span class='small'>2</span>. This it soon succeeds in bursting, and, rising to its full length,
balances itself a moment as in <span class='small'>3</span>, then, bending double, it ejects from its mouth
a glairy liquid, which instantly changes to silk, and fastens the posterior end to
the skin of the caterpillar, as shown in <span class='small'>4</span>, side view. It now begins to spin its
cocoon by attaching a silken thread to the silky mass by which it had previously
fastened itself to the caterpillar, and forming a series of loops of uniform size,
first from right to left, and then back again from left to right, as represented in
the front view, <span class='small'>5</span>, and better in the enlarged view, <span class='small'><i>5<sup>a</sup></i></span>, the arrow heads showing
the direction in which the head of the larva moved while forming the loops.
The ends of the series, numbered <span class='small'>1</span>, <span class='small'>2</span>, <span class='small'>3</span>, <span class='small'>4</span>, are fastened to the edges of the
ventral side of the body, which thus serves as a measure of the width of the
cocoon, and also acts as a support for the frail fabric in the first stages of spinning.
After the larva has fastened the fabric as far up on its ventral surface as
it can, conveniently, it then begins to spin free, as shown in the side view, <span class='small'>6</span>,
where it is represented as just completing the first half of its cocoon, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>resembles in form a slipper. This accomplished, the larva ceases to spin for
the time being, bends its head, as in <span class='small'>7</span>, towards its ventral surface, and pushes
the half cocoon free from its body. The form of the silken fabric enables it to
stand unsupported, while the larva, sliding its head down to the base, holds on
firmly until it swings its posterior end into the toe of the slipper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Figure 572, <span class='small'>8</span>, shows it in the act of changing end for end, and in <span class='small'>9</span> the larva
is seen erect, beginning at the base to complete the other half of its cocoon;
10 shows the larva contracting its body as it spins upward for about half the
length of the cocoon, when it again changes end for end, as shown in <span class='small'>11</span>, where
it is beginning at the upper part to unite the two sides, finally enclosing itself
as represented in <span class='small'>12</span>.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may now be seen, under the microscope, through the meshes of its cocoon
actively engaged in lining the interior with layers of very fine silk ejected from
its mouth in great abundance. One half of the cocoon is first lined by a forward
and back movement of its head, and then reversing its position, it lines the
other half in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>In one case the larva was disengaged from the skin of the caterpillar, after
beginning its cocoon. It, however, began again, and spun a portion while lying
on the table. This was removed, when it began a third time, and completed its
cocoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>In about 10 days the insect made its appearance through a hole in the upper
end, as represented in <span class='small'>13</span>. The top was eaten off in a perfect circle and hung by
a few threads, so as to resemble a lid as it was thrown back.</p>

<p class='c013'>One caterpillar observed had between 300 and 400 cocoons on its back and
sides, and another was dissected after more than 30 larvæ had escaped, and
130 were discovered in the soft integuments of the back.</p>

<p class='c013'>The figures from <span class='small'>1</span> to <span class='small'>13</span> are magnified five diameters, but in order to observe
the spinning of the cocoon a power of 50 is required. (Amer. Naturalist, xii,

<p class='c013'>While those chalcidid larvæ
which feed internally on their
host, as a rule, transform into
naked, more or less coarctate

larvæ of Copidosoma, Bothriothorax,
Homalotylus, and perhaps
others, which are much
crowded within their host, cause
a marked inflation of the body of
the latter (Figs. 573, 574). The nature of this cocoon-like cell, and how it is
produced, is unknown. “Its structure shows it not to be silk, nor yet the
last larval skin of the parasite, and whether it is an adventitious tissue of the
host-larva or a secretion of the parasite, or is explicable upon other grounds, I
cannot say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“These cases, with other refuse matters, collect in quantity within the bowel,
which becomes distended, since it has no opening. The imprisoned larva, having
little more than enough room for turning, must be freed of these objectionable
residua.... In a word, the larva turns its head upon its stomach, and pushes
the former towards the base of the cell until its position is reversed, the tail
being outwards; and, thus placed, it laps up all residue of food, especially from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>its old clothes previously referred to, until they are dried, and practically occupy
no space. It now throws up its stomach and bowel, with all their contents, and
without detaching them from its outer skin, which is moulted as before, but in
this instance to be pressed against the cell, so as to form for it an interior lining.
The dejectamenta of the bowel in this way lie between the cast skin and cell-wall
(as seen at <i>e</i>, Fig. 577), and so the larva remains absolutely unsoiled. It
now turns its head and resumes its old position, joining its cocoon to the edges
of its last cast skin, so that its habitation is relined, it is cleansed, and air can
still pass to it through the imperceptible openings left by the bees in the sealing.
This point is of radical importance, since breathing is carried on pretty rapidly
during the latter part of its subsequent transformations, the absorbed oxygen
permitting then of a production of heat, and causing also considerable diminution
in weight.”</p>

<h3 class='c002'>THE PUPA STATE</h3>
<p class='c006'>The word <i>pupa</i> is from the Latin meaning baby. Linnæus gave
it this name from its resemblance to a baby which has been swathed
or bound up, as is still the custom in Southern Europe. The term
<i>pupa</i> should be restricted to the resting inactive stage of the
holometabolous insects.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lamarck’s term <i>chrysalis</i> was applied to the complete or obtected pupa of
Lepidoptera and of certain Diptera, and <i>mumia</i>, a mummy, to the pupæ of
Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and most Hymenoptera. Latreille (1830) also restricted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>the term pupa to the “oviform nymph,” or puparium, of Diptera. Brauer
applies the term <i>nymph</i> to the pupa of metabolous insects.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The typical pupa is that of a moth or butterfly, popularly called a
chrysalis. A lepidopterous pupa in which the appendages are more
or less folded close to the body and
soldered to the integument, was called
by Linnæus a <i>pupa obtecta</i>; and when
the limbs are free, as in Neuroptera,
Mecoptera, Trichoptera, and the lepidopterous
genus Micropteryx it is called
a <i>pupa libera</i> (Fig. 579). When the
pupa is enclosed in the old larval skin,
which forms a pupal covering (puparium),
the pupa was said by Linnæus
to be <i>coarctate</i>. The pupa of certain
Diptera, as that of the orthoraphous
families, is nearly as much obtected as
that of the tineoid families of moths,
especially as regards the appendages
of the head; the legs being more as in <i>pupæ liberæ</i> (Fig. 580).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The male Coccid anticipates the metabolous insects in passing
through a quiescent state, when, as Westwood
states, it is “covered by the skin of the larva, or
by an additional pellicle.” The body appears to
be broad and flat, the antennæ and fore legs resting
under the head, while the two hinder pairs of legs
are appressed to the under side of the body.
There is but a slight approach to
the pupa libera of a metabolous
insect.</p>

<p class='c013'>Riley states that the male larva of
<i>Icerya purchasi</i> forms a cocoon waxy in
character, but lighter, more flossy, and
less adhesive than that of the female
egg-cocoon. It melts and disappears
when heated, proving its entirely waxy
nature. When the mass has reached
the proper length, the larva casts its
skin, which remains in the hind end of
the cocoon, and pushes itself forward
into the middle of the cocoon. The
pupa (Fig. 581) is of the same general
form and size as the larva. All the limbs are free and slightly movable, so that
they vary in position, though ordinarily the antennæ are pressed close to the side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>as are the wing-pads; the front pair of legs are extended forward. “If disturbed,
they twist and bend their bodies quite vigorously.” The pupa state lasts
two or three weeks. A similar pupa is that of <i>Icerya
rosæ</i>. (Riley and Howard.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The metamorphosis of <i>Aspidiotus perniciosus</i> is of
interest. The male nymph differs much after the first
moult from the female, having large purple eyes, while the female nymph
loses its eyes entirely. It passes into what Riley terms the <i>pro-pupa</i> (Fig. 582,
<i>b</i>), in which the wing-pads are present, while the limbs are short and thick.
The next stage is the “true pupa” (Fig. 582, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>), in which the antennæ and
legs are much longer than before. There is no waxy cocoon, but only a case
or scale composed of the shed larval skin, i.e. “with the first moult the shed
larval skin is retained beneath the scale, as in the case of the female; with the
later moultings the shed skins are pushed out from beneath the scale,” and when
they transform into the imago they “back out from the rear end of their
scale.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>The pupæ of Coleoptera and of Hymenoptera, though there is,
apparently, no near relationship between these two orders, are much
alike in shape, and, as Chapman pertinently suggests, those of both
orders are helpless from their quiescence, and hence have resorted
for protection to some cocoon or cell.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is quite otherwise with the pupæ of Lepidoptera and Diptera,
which vary so much in adaptation to their surroundings, and
hence afford important taxonomical and phylogenetic characters.
This, as regards the Lepidoptera, was almost wholly overlooked
until Chapman called attention to the subject, and showed that the
pupæ had characters of their own, of the greatest service in working
out the classification, and hence the phylogeny, of the different lepidopterous
groups. We have, following the lead of Chapman, found
the most striking confirmation of his views, and applied our present
knowledge of pupal structures to dividing the haustellate Lepidoptera
into two groups,—Paleolepidoptera and Neolepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pupæ of the Neuroptera, Coleoptera, and Hymenoptera differ
structurally from the imago, in the parts of the head and thorax
being less differentiated. Thus in the head the limits or sutures
between the epicranium and clypeus, and the occiput and gula, are
obscurely marked, while the tergal and pleural sclerites of the
imago are not well differentiated until the changes occurring just
before the final ecdysis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy, however, to homologize the appendages of the pupæ
with those of the imago of all the holometabolous orders except in
the case of the obtected pupa of the Lepidoptera (and probably of
the obtected dipterous pupæ), where the cephalic appendages are
soldered together.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the appendages of the lepidopterous pupa are, as generally
supposed, merely cases for those of the imago has been shown by
Poulton to be quite erroneous. He says: “If we examine a section
of a pupal antenna or leg (in Lepidoptera), we shall find that there
is no trace of the corresponding imaginal organ until shortly before
the emergence of the imago. In the numerous species with a long
pupal period, the formation of imaginal appendages within those of
the pupa is deferred until very late, and then takes place rapidly in
the lapse of a few weeks. This also strengthens the conclusion that
such pupal appendages are not mere cases for the parts of the imago,
inasmuch as these latter are only contained within them for a very
small proportion of the whole pupal period.” On the other hand,
Miall and Hammond claim that there is a strong superficial contrast
as to the formation of the imaginal organs, between Lepidoptera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>and tipularian Diptera, the appendages, wings, and compound eyes
being substantially those of the imago. “With the exception of the
prothoracic respiratory appendages and the tail-fin, there is little in
the pupa of Chironomus which does not relate to the next stage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The exact homology of the “glazed eye” of the lepidopterous
pupæ and of the parts under the head, situated over the maxillæ, is
difficult to decide upon, and these points need farther examination.
In the dipterous pupa it is interesting to observe that the halteres
are large and broad, which plainly indicates that they are modified
hind wings. The number and arrangement of the spiracles is different
in pupæ from those of the larva and imago.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There are also secondary adaptive structures peculiar to the pupa,
which are present and only of use in this stage. These are the
thoracic, spiracular, or breathing appendages of the aquatic Diptera
(Fig. 583), the various spines situated on the head or thorax, or on
the sides, or more often at the end of the abdomen, besides also the
little spines arranged in more or less circular rows around the abdominal
segments, the cocoon-breaker, and the cremaster of many pupæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the pupa of certain Diptera, there is a terminal cremaster-like
spine, as in that of <i>Tipula eluta</i> (Fig. 584), <i>Tabanus lineola</i> (Fig. 585),
besides adminicula or locomotive spines like those of lepidopterous
pupæ (Fig. 580, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The pupæ of Coleoptera are variously spined or hairy (Fig. 586).
Those of Hydrophilus and of Hydrobius are provided with stout
spines on the prothorax and abdomen which support the body in its
cells, so that, as Lyonet first showed,
though surrounded on all sides by
moist earth, it is kept from contact
with it by the pupal spines; other
pupæ of beetles, such as that of the
plum weevil, which is also subterranean,
possess similar spines. The
abdomen of many coleopterous pupæ,
such as those of Carabidæ, end in two
spines, to aid them in escaping from
their cells in wood or in the earth;
others have stiff bristles, and others
spines along each side of the abdomen
(Fig. 586). All these structures are
the result of a certain amount of
activity in what we call quiescent
pupæ, but most of these are for
use at the end of pupal life, at the
critical moment when by their aid the
insect escapes from its cocoon or subterranean
cell, or if parasitic, bores out of its host.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we are to account for the causes of their origin,
we are obliged to infer that they are temporary deciduous structures
due to the need of support while the body is subjected to unusual
strains and stresses in working its way out of its prison in the earth,
or its cell within the stems and trunks of plants and similar situations.
They are pupal inheritances or heirlooms, and well illustrate
the inheritance of characters acquired during a certain definite,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>usually brief, period of life, and transmitted by the action of synchronous
heredity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pupæ of certain insects are quite active, thus that of Raphidia,
unlike that of Sialis, before its final ecdysis regains its
activity and is able to run about. (Sharp, p. 448.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The pupa considered in reference to its adaptation to its surroundings and its relation to phylogeny</h4>

<p class='c016'>The form of the pupa is a very variable one, as even in Lepidoptera
it is not entirely easy to draw the line between a pupa libera and a
pupa obtecta (Fig. 578); and though the period is one of inactivity, yet
when they are not in cocoons or in the earth in subterranean cells,
their form is more or less variable and adapted to changes in their
surroundings. Even in the obtected pupa of butterflies, there is,
as every one knows, considerable variability of shape and of armature,
which seems to be in direct adaptability to the nature of their
environment. Scudder has well shown that in certain chrysalids,
such as those of the Nymphalidæ, which are variously tuberculated,
and hang suspended by the tail, and often hibernate, these projections
serve to protect the body. All chrysalids with projections or
ridges on different parts of the body, being otherwise unprotected,
move freely when struck by gusts of wind, hence “the greater the
danger to the chrysalis from surrounding objects, the greater its
protection by horny tubercles and roughened callous ridges.” The
greater the protection possessed in other ways, as by firm swathing
or a safe retreat, the smoother the surface of the body and the more
regular and rounded its contours. The tendency to protection by
tubercles is especially noticeable in certain South American chrysalids
of nymphalid butterflies. This response to the stimuli of blows
or shocks is also accompanied by a sensitiveness to the stimulus of
too strong light.</p>

<p class='c007'>Previously Scudder<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a> had made the important suggestion that the
smooth crescent-shaped belt of the “glazed eye” or “eyepiece” of
chrysalids is, as an external covering of the eye, midway between
that of the caterpillar and the perfect insect, and he asks: “May it
not be a relic of the past, the external organ of what once was?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>And are we to look upon this as our hint that the archaic butterfly
in its transformations passed through an <i>active</i> pupal stage, like the
lowest insect of to-day, when its limbs were unsheathed, its appetite
unabated?” etc. Scudder also shows that “the expanded base of
the sheath covering the tongue affords protection also to the palpi
which lie beneath and beside the tongue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All this tends to show the importance of studying the structure
of the pupa, in order to ascertain how the pupal structures have
been brought about, with the final object of discovering whether the
pupæ of the holometabolic insects are not descended from active
nymphs, and if so, the probable course of the line of descent.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> Mode of escape of the pupa from its cocoon</h4>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“In all protected pupæ,” as Chapman says, “the problem has to
be faced, how is the imago to free itself from the cocoon or other
envelope protecting the
pupa.” In the Coleoptera
and Hymenoptera the imago
becomes perfected within the
cocoon or cell, as the case
may be, and as Chapman
states, “not only throws off
the pupal skin within the
cocoon, but remains there till
its appendages have become
fully expanded and completely
hardened, and then
the mandibles are used to
force an outlet of escape,”
and he calls attention to the
fact that “in many cases,
even in some entire families,
they are of no use whatever
to the imago except in this
one particular,” and he cites
the Cynipidæ as perhaps the
most striking instance of this
circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those Neuroptera which
spin a silken cocoon, <i>e.g.</i> the
Hemerobiidæ, the Trichoptera,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>and in Micropteryx (Fig. 588), the jaws used by the pupa for
cutting its way out of the cocoon are even larger in proportion than
in the pupa of caddis-flies (Fig. 588), being of extraordinary size.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In Myrmeleon the pupa
pushes its way half out of
the cocoon, and then remains,
while the imago ruptures the skin and escapes (Fig. 589, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in the Neuroptera and Trichoptera we have already established
the more fundamental methods of escape from the cocoon,
which we see carried out in various ways in the more generalized
or primitive Lepidoptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most primitive method in the Lepidoptera of escaping from
the cocoon seems to be that of Micropteryx.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“In this genus,” says Chapman, “though it is nominally the pupa that
escapes from the cocoon, it is in reality still the imago, the imago clothed in the
effete pupal skin. To rupture the cocoon it uses not its own jaws, but those of
the pupal skin, energizing them, however, in some totally different way from
ordinary direct muscular action, their movements being the result of the vermicular
movements of the pupa, acting probably by fluid pressure on the articular
structure of the jaws, by some arrangement not altogether different perhaps
from the frontal sac of the higher Diptera. In the Micropteryges the jaws of
the pupa not only rupture the cocoon, but appear to be the most active agents
in dragging the pupa through the opening in the cocoon and through any superincumbent
earth, being merely assisted by the vermicular action of the abdominal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>segments, and we find in accordance with this circumstance that the pupal
envelope is still very thin and delicate, and has little or no hardening or roughness
by which to obtain a leverage against the walls of the channel of escape.”

<p class='c007'>Some sort of a beak or hard process, more or less developed,

in nearly all the Lepidoptera with incomplete pupæ (<i>pupæ incompletæ</i>),
except the limacodid and nepticulid section. “In all these
instances the pupa emerges from the cocoon precisely as in the
Micropteryges, that is, the moth it really is that emerges, but does
so encased in the pupal skin. To achieve this object, it seems to
have been found most efficient to have three, four, or five abdominal
segments capable of movement, but to have the terminal
sections (segments) soldered together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This cocoon-breaker, as we may call it, is especially
developed in <i>Lithocolletis hamadryadella</i>. As described
by Comstock, it forms a toothed crest on the
forehead which enables it to pierce or saw through
the cocoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Each pupa first sawed through the cocoon near its juncture
with the leaf and worked its way through the gap, by
means of the minute backward-directed spines upon its back,
until it reached the upper cuticle of the leaf. Through this
cuticle it sawed in the same way that it did through the
cocoon. The hole was in each case just large enough to permit
the chrysalis to work its way out, holding it firmly when
partly emerged. When half-way out it stopped, and presently
the skin split across the back of the neck and down in front
along the antennal sheaths, and allowed the moth to
emerge.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We have observed and figured the cocoon-breaker
in Bucculatrix, Talæporia (Fig. 590, <i>a</i>), Thyridopteryx,
and Œceticus, and rough knobs or slight projection
answering the purpose in Hepialidæ, Megalopyge,

on the head of <i>Sesia tipuliformis</i> (Fig. 578).</p>

<p class='c007'>The imago of the attacine moths cuts or saws
through its cocoon by means of a pair of large, stout, black spines
(<i>sectores coconis</i>), one on each side of the thorax at the base of the
fore wings (Fig. 591), and provided with five or six teeth on the cutting
edge (<i>C</i>, <i>D</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>Our attention<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> was drawn to this subject by a rustling, cutting, and tearing
noise issuing from a cocoon of <i>Actias luna</i>. On examination a sharp black point
was seen moving to and fro, and then another, until both points had cut a rough
irregular slit, through which the shoulder of the moth could be seen vigorously
moving from side to side. The hole or slit was made in one or two minutes, and
the moth worked its way at once out of the slit. The cocoon was perfectly dry.
The cocoon-cutter occurs in all the American genera, in <i>Samia cynthia</i>, and is
large and well marked in the European <i>Saturnia pavonia-minor</i> and <i>Endromis
versicolora</i>. In <i>Bombyx mori</i> the spines are not well marked, and they are
quite different from those in the Attaci. There are three sharp points, being
acute angles of the pieces at the base of the wing, and it must be these spines
which at times perform the cutting through of the threads of the cocoon described
by Réaumur, and which he thought was done by the facets of the eyes. It is
well known that in order to guard against the moths cutting the threads, silkraisers
expose the cocoon to heat sufficient to destroy the enclosed pupa. In
Platysamia the cocoon-cutters, though well developed, do not appear to be used
at all, and the pupa, like that of the silkworm and other moths protected by a
cocoon, moistens the silk threads by a fluid issuing from the mouth, which also
moistens the hairs of the head and thorax, together with the antennæ. It
remains to be seen whether these structures are only occasionally used, and
whether the emission of the fluid is not the usual and normal means of egress
of the moth from its cocoon. Dr. Chapman remarks that throughout the obtected
moths “there are many devices for breaking through the cocoon: specially constructed
weak places in the cocoon, softening fluid, applied by the moth, assisted
by special appliances of diverse sorts, such as in Hybocampa<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a> and Attacus,” etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the fluid mentioned above, Trouvelot states that it is secreted during
the last few days of the pupa state, and is a dissolvent for the gum so firmly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>uniting the fibres of the cocoon. “This liquid is composed in great part of
bombycic acid.” (Amer. Naturalist, i, p. 33.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The pupa of the dipterous genus Sciara (<i>S. ocellaris</i> O. S.) resembles a tineid
pupa, and before transforming emerges for about two-thirds of its length from
the cocoon; the pupa-skin remaining firmly attached in this position.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Certain hymenopterous pupæ are provided with temporary deciduous conical
processes. Thus we have observed in the pupa of <i>Rhopalum pedicellatum</i> two
very prominent acute tubercles between the eyes (<i>h</i>, Fig. 592). As the cocoon
is very slight, these may be of use either in extracting itself from the silken
threads or in pushing its way along before emerging from the tunnel in the stem
of plants. (See also p. 611.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> The cremaster</h4>

<p class='c016'>Although this structure is in general confined to lepidopterous
pupæ, and is not always present even in them, since it is purely
adaptive in its nature, yet on account of its singular mode of development
from the larval organs, and the accompanying changes in the
pupal abdomen, it should be mentioned in this connection. The
cremaster is the stout, triangular, flattened, terminal spine of the
abdomen, which aids the pupa in working its way out of the earth
when the pupa is subterranean, or in the pupa of silk-spinning caterpillars
its armature of secondary hooks and curved setæ enables it
to retain its hold on the threads of the interior of its cocoon after
the pupa has partially emerged from the cocoon, restraining it, as
Chapman well says, “at precisely that degree of emergence from
the cocoon that is most desirable.” He also informs us that while
in the “<i>pupæ incompletæ</i> the cremaster is attached to an extensible
cable, which always allows some emergence of the pupa, in the
pupæ obtectæ there is no doubt but that in such cases as the Ichthyuræ,
Acronyctæ, and many others, it retains the pupal case in
the same position within the cocoon that the living pupa occupied;
this is also very usually the case in the Geometræ and in the higher
tineids (my pyraloids).”</p>

<p class='c013'>In many of the more generalized moths there is no cremaster (Micropteryx,
Gracilaria, Prodoxus, Tantura, Talæporia, Psychidæ, Hepialidæ, Zeuzera, Nola,
Harrisina), though in Tischeria and Talæporia (Fig. 590, but not in Solenobia)
and Psychidæ, two stout terminal spines perform the office of a cremaster, or
there are simply curved setæ on the rounded, unarmed end of the abdomen, as
in Solenobia.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the obtected Lepidoptera, for example in such a group as the Notodontidæ,
where the cremaster is present, though variable in shape, it may from disuse,
owing to the dense cocoon, be without the spines and hooks in Cerura, or
the cremaster itself is entirely wanting in Gluphisia, and only partially developed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>in Notodonta. In the butterflies whose pupæ are suspended (Suspensi),
the cremaster is especially well developed. Reference might here be made to
the temporary pupal structures in certain generalized moths, which take the
place of a cremaster, such as the transverse terminal row of spines in Tinea,
the two stout spines in Tischeria, and the dense rough integument and thickened
callosities of the pupal head and end of abdomen of Phassus, which bores in
trees with very hard wood; also the numerous stout spines at the end and
sides of the abdomen in Ægerians. These various projections and spines, besides
acting as anchors and grappling hooks, in some cases serve to resist strains
and blows, and have undoubtedly, like the armature in the larvæ and imagines
of other insects, arisen in response to intermittent or occasional pressure,
stresses, and impacts.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Mode of formation of the cremaster and suspension of the chrysalis in
butterflies.</b>—We are indebted to Riley<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a> for an explanation of the
way the cremaster has originated, his observations having been
made on species of over a dozen genera of butterflies (Suspensi).</p>

<p class='c007'>He shows that the cremaster is the homologue of the suranal
plate of the larva.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a> The preliminary acts of the larva have been
observed by various authors since the days of Vallisneri, <i>i.e.</i> the
larva hanging by the end of the abdomen, turning up the anterior
part of the body in a more or less complete curve, and the skin
finally splitting from the head to the front edge of the metathoracic
segment, and being worked back in a shrivelled mass toward the
point of attachment. The critical feat, adds Riley, which has most
puzzled naturalists, is the independent attachment of the chrysalis
and the withdrawal from and riddance of the larval skin which such
attachment implies. Réaumur explained this in 1734 by the clutching
of the larval skin between sutures of the terminal segments of
the chrysalis, and this is the case, though the sutures act in a somewhat
different way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before pupation the larva spins a mass or heap of silk, the shape of which is
like an inverted settee or a ship’s knee, and “one of the most interesting acts of
the larva, preliminary to suspension, is the bending and working of the anal
parts in order to fasten the back of the (suranal) plate to the inside of the back
of the settee, while the crotchets of the legs are entangled in the more flattened
position or seat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In shedding the larval skin, the following parts are also shed, and have some
part to play in the act of suspension: <i>i.e.</i> 1st, the tracheal ligaments (Fig. 593,
<i>tl</i>), or the shed tracheæ from the last or 9th pair of spiracles; 2d, the rectal
ligament (Fig. 593, <i>rl</i>), or shed intestinal canal; 3d, the Osborne or retaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>membrane (<i>membrana retinens</i>, Fig. 593, <i>mr</i>), which is the stretched part of
the membrane around the rectum and in the anal legs, and which is intimately
associated with the rectal ligament.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The structures in the chrysalis are, first, the cremaster, with its dorsal (Fig.
594, <i>dcr</i>) and ventral (<i>vcr</i>) ridges, and the cremastral hook-pad (<i>chp</i>), said by
Riley to be “thickly studded with minute but stout hooks, which are sometimes
compound or furnished with barbs, very much as are some of our fishing-hooks,
and which are most admirably adapted to the purpose for which they are
intended.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Secondly, there are the other structures, viz., the sustainers (<i>sustentors</i>),
two projections which Riley states “homologize with the soles (<i>plantæ</i>) of the
anal prolegs, which take on various forms (3), but are always directed forward
so as easily to catch hold of the retaining membrane.” These sustentors are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>however, as Jackson<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> has shown, and as we are satisfied, the vestiges of the
anal legs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Thirdly, the sustentor ridges, which, as Riley states, may be more or less
obsolete in some forms, in Paphia (Fig. 596, <i>B</i>) and Limenitis form “quite
a deep notch, which doubtless assists in catching hold of the larval skin in the
efforts to attach the cremaster.”</p>

In all the figures the joints of the body are numbered; the forming chrysalis is shaded in transverse lines; the intervening space between it and larval skin is dotted: <i>h</i>, is the hillock of silk; <i>hl</i>, hooks of hind legs; <i>ap</i>, anal plate; <i>lr</i>, larval rectum; <i>pr</i>, pupal rectum; <i>mr</i>, retaining membrane; <i>c</i>, cremaster; <i>s</i>, sustainers.—This and Figs. 593–596 after Riley.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“It is principally,” adds Riley, “by the leverage obtained by the hooking of
the sustainers in the retaining membrane, which acts as a swimming fulcrum,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>that the chrysalis is prevented from falling after the cremaster is withdrawn
from the larval skin. It is also principally by this same means that it is enabled
to reach the silk with the cremastral hook-pads.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dissected immediately after suspension, the last abdominal segment of the
larva is found to be bathed, especially between the legs and around the rectum,
in an abundance of translucent, membranous material.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An hour or more after suspension the end of the forming chrysalis begins to
separate from the larval skin, except at the tip of the cremaster (Fig. 597, <i>b</i>).
Gradually the skin of the legs and of the whole subjoint (10th segment)
stretches, and with the stretching, the cremaster elongates, the rectal piece
recedes more and more from the larval rectum, and the sustentor ridges diverge
more and more from the cremaster, carrying with them, on the sustainers, a
part of the soft membrane.” The rectal ligament will sustain at least 10 or 12
times the weight of the chrysalis. That of Apatura seems to rely almost
entirely on the rectal ligament, assisted by the partial holding of the delicate
larval skin.</p>

<h3 class='c002'>FORMATION OF THE PUPA AND IMAGO IN THE HOLOMETABOLOUS INSECTS (THE DIPTERA EXCEPTED)</h3>
<p class='c006'>We have seen that in the incomplete metamorphosis, although
there may be as many as five, and possibly seven moults, and in
Chloëon as many as 20, and in <i>Cicada septemdecim</i> perhaps 25 or 30,
there is but a slight change of form from one stage to another, and
no period of inactivity. And this gradual outer transformation is
so far as yet known paralleled by that of the internal organs, the
slight successive changes of which do not differ from those observed
in the growth of ametabolous insects. With the growth of the
internal organs there probably goes on a series of gradual regenerative
processes, and Korschelt and Heider state that we may venture
to assume that each changed cell or group of cells which have become
exhausted by the exercise of the functions of life are reabsorbed
and become restored through the vital powers of the tissues,
so that as the result there goes on a constant, gradual regeneration
of the organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the Hemiptera have only an incomplete metamorphosis, the
males of the Coccidæ are, as shown by O. Schmidt, remarkable for
passing through a complete or holometabolous development, with
four stages, three of which are pupal and inactive. Hence, as
Schmidt observes, there is here a hypermetamorphosis, like that of
the Meloidæ, Stylopidæ, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly before the end of the larval stage of the male appear the
imaginal buds of the eyes, legs, and wings. In the 2d or 1st pupal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>stage there is an atrophy of the antennæ and legs. On the other
hand, at this stage the female completes its metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rudiments of the wings arise on the edge of the dorsal and
ventral side of the 2d thoracic segment, and this, we would remark,
is significant as showing a mode of origin of the wings intermediate
between that of the manometamorphic and holometamorphic insects.
(See pp. 137–142.) While Schmidt could not ascertain the exact
structure of the imaginal buds, he says “in general the process of
formation of the extremities is exactly as Weismann has described
in Corethra.” The two later pupal stages are “as in other metabolic
insects.” (See p. 690, Fig. 637.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far the internal changes in the metamorphosis of the
Coleoptera have not been thoroughly studied. They are less complete
than in the other holometabolous insects, the differences between
the larva and imago being much less marked than in the
more specialized orders, and so far as known all the larval organs
pass, though not without some great changes, directly into the
imaginal ones, the only apparent exception being the mid-intestine,
which, as stated by Kowalevsky, undergoes a complete transformation
during metamorphosis. The following account, then, refers
almost wholly to the Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>a.</i> The Lepidoptera</h4>

<p class='c016'>The first observations on the complete metamorphosis of insects
which were in any way exact were those of Malpighi, in 1667, and
of Swammerdam, in 1733. While the observations of Swammerdam,
as far as they extended, were correct, his conclusions were extraordinary.
They were, however, accepted by Réaumur and by Bonnet,
and generally held until the time of Herold in 1815, and lingered
on for some years after. The rather famous theory of incasement
(“<i>emboîtement</i>”) propounded by Swammerdam was that the form of
the larva, pupa, and imago preëxisted in the egg, and even in the
ovary; and that the insects in these stages were distinct animals,
contained one inside the other, like a nest of boxes, or a series of
envelopes one within the other, or, to use his own words: “<i>Animal
in animali, seu papilio intra erucam reconditus.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>This theory Swammerdam extended to the whole animal kingdom.
It was based on the fact that by throwing the caterpillar, when
about to pupate, in boiling water, and then stripping off the skin,
the immature form of the butterfly with its appendages was disclosed.
Malpighi had previously observed the same fact in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>silkworm, perceiving that before pupation the antennæ are concealed
in the head of the larva, where they occupy the place previously
taken by the mandibular muscles; also that the legs of the moth
grew in those of the larva, and that the wings developed from the
sides of the worm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even Réaumur (1734) remarked: “Les parties du papillon
cachées sous le fourreau de chenille sont d’autant plus faciles à
trouver que la transformation est plus proche. Elles y sont neanmoins
de tout temps.” He also believed in the simultaneous existence
of two distinct beings in the insect. “Il serait très curieux de
connaître toutes les communications intimes qui sont entre la chenille
et le papillon.... La chenille hache, broye, digere les aliments
qu’elle distribué au papillon; comme les mères préparent ceux qui
sont portés aux fœtus. Notre chenille en un mot est destineé à
nourrir et à defendre le papillon qu’elle renferme.” (T. i, 8<sup>e</sup> Mémoire,
p. 363.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Lyonet (1760), even, did not expose the error of this view that
the larva enveloped the pupa and imago, and, as Gonin says, it was
undoubtedly because he did not use for his dissections of the caterpillar
of Cossus any specimens about to pupate. Yet he detected
the wing-germs and those of the legs, stating that he presumed the
bodies he saw to be the rudiments of the legs of the moth (p. 450).</p>

<p class='c007'>Herold, in his work on the development of the butterfly (1815),
was the first to object to this erroneous theory, showing that the
wings did not become visible until the very end of larval life; that
as the larval organs disappear, they are transformed or are replaced
by entirely new organs, which is not reconcilable with a simple putting
off of the outer envelope. The whole secret of metamorphosis,
in Herold’s opinion, consisted in this fact, that the butterfly in the
larva state increases and accumulates a supply of fat until it has
reached the volume of the perfect state; then it begins the chrysalis
period, during which the organs are developed and take their definite
form.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> (Abstract mostly from Gonin.) Still the old ideas prevailed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>and even Lacordaire, in his Introduction à l’Entomologie published in
1834, held on to Swammerdam’s theory, declaring that “a caterpillar
is not a simple animal, but compound,” and he actually goes so far
as to say that “a caterpillar, at first scarcely as large as a bit of
thread, contains its own teguments threefold and even eightfold in
number, besides the case of a chrysalis, and a complete butterfly,
all lying one inside the other.” This view, however, we find is not
original with Lacordaire, but was borrowed from Kirby and Spence
without acknowledgment. These authors, in their Introduction to
Entomology (1828), combated Herold’s views and stoutly maintained
the old opinions of Swammerdam. They based their opinions on
the fact, then known, that certain parts of the imago occur in the
caterpillar. On the other hand, Herold denied that the successive
skins of the pupa and imago existed as germs, holding that they are
formed successively from the “<i>rete mucosum</i>,” which we suppose to
be the hypodermis of later authors. In a slight degree the Swammerdam-Kirby
and Spence doctrine was correct, as the imago does
arise from germs, <i>i.e.</i> the imaginal disks of Weismann, while this
was not discovered by Herold, though they do at the outset arise
from the hypodermis, his <i>rete mucosum</i>. Thus there was a grain of
truth in the Swammerdam-Kirby and Spence doctrine, and also a
mixture of truth and error in the opinions of Herold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The real nature of the internal changes wrought during the
process of metamorphosis was first revealed by Weismann in 1864.
His discovery of the germs of the imago (imaginal buds) of the
Diptera, and his theory of <i>histolysis</i>, or of the complete destruction
of the larval organs by a gradual process, was the result of the application
of modern methods of embryology and histology, although
his observations were first made on the extremely modified type of the
Muscidæ or flies, and, at first, he did not extend his view to include
all the holometabolous insects. Now, thanks to his successors in
this field, Ganin, Dewitz, Kowalevsky, Van Rees, Bugnion, Gonin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>and others, we see that metamorphosis is, after all, only an extension
of embryonic life, the moults and great changes being similar to
those undergone by the embryo, and that metamorphosis and alternation
of generations are but terms in a single series. Moreover,
the metamorphoses of insects are of the same general nature as
those of certain worms, of the echinoderms, and the frog, the
different stages of larva, pupa, and imago being adaptational and
secondary.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the changes in form from the larva to the pupa are apparently
sudden, the internal histogenetic steps which lead to them are
gradual. In the Lepidoptera a few days (usually from one to three)
before assuming the pupa stage, the caterpillar becomes restless and
ceases to take food. Its excrements are now hard, dry, and, according
to Gonin, are “stained carmine red by the secretions of the
urinary tubes.” Under the microscope we find that they are almost
exclusively composed of fragments of the intestinal epithelium.
These red dejections were noticed by Réaumur, and afterwards by
Herold, and they are sure indications of the approach of the transformations.
It now wanders about, and, if it is a spinner, spins its
cocoon, and then lies quietly at rest while the changes are going on
within its body. Meanwhile, it lives on the stores of fat in the fat-body,
and this supply enables it to survive the pupal period.</p>

<p class='c013'>The amount of fat is sometimes very great. Newport removed from the larva
of <i>Cossus ligniperda</i> 42 grains of fat, being more than one-fourth of the whole
weight of the insect, he adds that the supply is soon nearly exhausted during
the rapid development of the reproductive organs, “since, when these have
become perfected, the quantity that remains is very inconsiderable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the larval skin of a lepidopterous insect is suddenly
cast off, the pupa quickly emerging front it, yet there are several
intermediate stages, all graduating into each other. If a caterpillar
of a Clisiocampa, which, as we have observed, is much shortened
and thickened a day or two before changing to a pupa, is hardened
in alcohol and the larval skin is stripped off, the semipupa (pro-nymph,
pro-pupa of different authors) is found to be in different
stages of development, and the changes of the mouth-parts are
interesting, though not yet sufficiently studied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Newport attributes the great enlargement and changes in the
shape of the thoracic segments of the larva of <i>Vanessa urticæ</i> at
this time, to the contraction or shortening of the muscles of the
interior of those segments, “which are repeatedly slowly extended
and shortened, as if the insect were in the act of laborious respiration.”
This, he adds, generally takes place at short intervals during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>the two hours immediately preceding the change to the pupa, and
increases in frequency as that period approaches. He thus describes
the mode of moulting the larval skin: “When the period has arrived,
the skin bursts along the dorsal part of the 3d segment, or mesothorax,
and is extended along the 2d and 4th, while the coverings
of the head separate into three pieces. The insect then exerts
itself to the utmost to extend the fissure along the segment of the
abdomen, and, in the meantime, pressing its body through the opening,
gradually withdraws its antennæ and legs, while the skin, by
successive contortions of the abdomen, is slipped backwards, and
forced towards the extremity of the body, just as a person would
slip off his glove or his stocking. The efforts of the insect to get
entirely rid of it are then very great; it twirls itself in every
direction in order to burst the skin, and, when it has exerted itself
in this manner for some time, twirls itself swiftly, first in one
direction, then in the opposite, until at last the skin is broken
through and falls to the ground, or is forced to some distance from
it. The new pupa then hangs for a few seconds at rest, but its
change is not yet complete. The legs and antennæ, which when
withdrawn from the old skin were disposed along the under surface
of the body, are yet separate, and do not adhere together as they do
a short time afterwards. The wings are also separate and very
small. In a few seconds the pupa makes several slow, but powerful,
respiratory efforts; during which the abdominal segments become
more contracted along their under surface, and the wings are much
enlarged and extended along the lateral inferior surface of the
body, while a very transparent fluid, which facilitated the slipping
off of the skin, is now diffused among the limbs, and when the pupa
becomes quiet dries, and unites the whole into one compact covering.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The changes in the head and mouth-parts.</b>—The changes of form
from the active mandibulate caterpillar to the quiescent pupa, and
then to the adult butterfly, are, as we have seen, in direct adaptation
to their changed habits and surroundings, and they differ greatly in
details in insects of different orders. In many Lepidoptera and
certain Diptera the pupa and imago are without the mandibles of the
larva, and, instead, the 1st maxillæ in the former order, and the 2d
maxillæ in the latter, are highly developed and specialized. The
changes in the shape of the head, with the antennæ, the latter rudimentary
in the larvæ of the two orders named, are noteworthy, and
will be referred to under those orders. The same may be said of
the thorax with the legs and wings, and the abdomen with the ovipositor.
Every part of the body undergoes a profound change, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>in the Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and the more generalized and primitive
Diptera, each segment and appendage of the larva are directly
transformed into the corresponding parts of
the pupa, and subsequently of the imago. We
shall see, however, beyond, that this general
statement does not apply to the Hymenoptera,
in which there is a process of cephalization
or transfer of parts headward, peculiar to that
order.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>The change in the internal organs.</b>—These
were especially, as regards the nervous system,
first carefully examined and illustrated
by that great English entomotomist, Newport, and those of the
reproductive organs by Herold as early as 1815. A glance at the
figures (598–604), reproduced from Newport’s article Insecta, will
show the changes wrought especially
in the digestive and nervous systems
of Sphinx and Vanessa, his account of
the alterations in the muscles having
already been quoted. As the pupal
form is much nearer to that of the
imago than of the larva, so the digestive
canal is seen to be nearly as much
differentiated in the pupa as in the
imago, though the reservoir (“sucking-stomach”)
of the imago is not
indicated in the pupa. These changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>are such as occur in an insect which is enormously voracious as a
larva, and which often, passing through a period of complete inactivity,
taking no food at all, finally becomes an insect which needs
to suck in only a minimum quantity of water or nectar, and which
practically abstains from all food. The head and genital glands
also, as well as the urinary vessels, are nearly the same. On the
other hand, the salivary glands have undergone, in the imago, a
thoroughgoing reduction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The changes undergone by the nervous system of <i>Sphinx ligustri</i>
and <i>Vanessa urticæ</i> have been described by Newport with fulness of
detail. An abstract of his observations on <i>Vanessa urticæ</i>, which
undergoes its changes in June in 14 days, and in August in eight
days, we will now give, in part verbatim, the subject being rendered
much clearer by his figures, which are reproduced.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the last larval stage, certain changes have already taken place in different
parts of the cord, which shows that they had been a long time in progress.
Besides the lateral approximation of the cords, the first change consists in a
union of the 11th and 12th ganglia, the latter one being carried forwards; these
two ganglia being entirely separate before the 3d moult.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two hours after the larva of <i>Vanessa urticæ</i> has suspended itself in order to
pupate, the brain is not yet enlarged, but the subœsophageal ganglion is nearly
twice its original size and the ganglia behind are nearer together. “A little
while before the old larval skin is thrown off there is great excitement throughout
the body of the insect.” About half an hour (Fig. 603, <span class='small'>2</span>) before this occurs
the alary nerves and the cerebral, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th ganglia are slightly
enlarged, and the 1st subœsophageal ganglion very considerably. Immediately
after the insect has entered the pupa state (Fig. 603, <span class='small'>3</span>), all the ganglia are
brought closer together. One hour after (Fig. 603, <span class='small'>4</span>) pupation the cerebral ganglia
are found to be more closely united, the 4th and 5th ganglia are nearer, and
the distance between the remaining ganglia is also reduced.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seven hours after pupation there is a greater enlargement of the cerebral ganglia,
optic nerves, and ganglia and cords of the future thoracic segments.</p>

<p class='c013'>At 12 hours (Fig. 603, <span class='small'>5</span>) the 5th pair of ganglia has almost completely coalesced
with the cord and the 4th; at 18 hours (Fig. 603, <span class='small'>6</span>) the whole of the ganglia,
cords, and nerves have become more enlarged, especially those of the wings,
while the 4th and 5th ganglia of the cords have now so completely united as to
appear like an irregular elongated mass. At 24 hours (Fig. 604, <span class='small'>7</span>) the 4th and 5th
ganglia are completely united, the 5th being larger than the 4th. At 36 hours
(Fig. 604, <span class='small'>8</span>) the optic nerves have attained a size almost equal to that of the
brain. The 1st subœsophageal ganglion now forms, with the cerebral ones, a
complete ring around the œsophagus, the crura having almost disappeared.
The 6th ganglion has now disappeared, but the nerves arising from it remain.
At 48 hours (Fig. 604, <span class='small'>9</span>) the cord is straight instead of being sinuous, and the
7th ganglion has disappeared, while the thoracic ganglia are greatly enlarged.
At the end of 58 hours the 2d and 3d thoracic ganglia have united, and the
double ganglion thus formed is only separated from the large thoracic mass composed
of the 4th, 5th, and part of the 6th ganglia, by the short but greatly enlarged
cords which pass on each side of the central attachment of the muscles.
“The optic and antennal nerves have nearly attained their full development,
and those numerous and most intricate plexus of nerves in the three thoracic
segments of the larva form only a few trunks, which can hardly be recognized
as the same structures. The arrangement of the whole nervous system is now
nearly as it exists in the perfect insect. The whole of these important changes
are thus seen to take place within the first three days after the insect has undergone
its metamorphosis; and they precede those of the alimentary canal,
generative system, and other organs, which are still very far from being completed,
and indeed, as compared with the nervous system, have made but little
progress.” (Art. Insecta, pp. 962–965.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>The initial steps and many of the subsequent internal changes
escaped the notice of Newport and others of his time, and it was
not until the epoch-making work of Weismann on the ultimate
processes of transformation of Corethra and of Musca, that we had
an adequate knowledge of the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>Weismann (1864) was the first to show for the Muscidæ and
Corethra that the appendages, wings, and other parts of the imago
originate in separate, minute, cellular masses called imaginal disks,
buds, or folds (histoblasts of Künckel). These imaginal buds,
which arise from the hypodermis, being masses of indifferent cells,
are usually present in the very young larva, and even in the later
embryonic stages. It has been shown that such imaginal buds exist
for each part of the body, not only for the appendages and wings
(p. 126), but for the different sections of the digestive canal. During
the semipupal stage these buds enlarge, grow, and at the same
time there is a corresponding destruction of the larval organs.
The process of destruction is due to the activity of the blood corpuscles
or leucocytes (phagocytes), the larval organs thus broken
up forming a creamy mass, the buds from which the new organs
are to arise resisting the attacks of the virulent leucocytes, which
attach themselves to the weakened tissue and engulf the pigments
(see p. 422). The two processes of destruction of the larval organs
(histolysis) and the building up of the imaginal organs (histogenesis)
go hand in hand, so that the connection of the organs in question in
most cases remains entirely continuous; while the last steps in the
destruction of the larval organs only take place after the organs of
the imago have assumed their definite shape and size. Other observers
have corroborated and confirmed his statements and observations,
Gonin extending them to the Lepidoptera and Bugnion to
the Hymenoptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a pity that the observations, such as were set on foot by
Weismann, were not first made on the Trichoptera and Lepidoptera,
which are much more primitive and unmodified forms than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_651'>651</span>Diptera, but mistakes of this nature have frequently happened in the
history of science.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latest and most detailed researches are those of J. Gonin on
the metamorphoses of <i>Pieris brassicæ</i>, made under the direction of
Professor E. Bugnion. They fill an important gap in our knowledge,
and show that the Lepidoptera transform in nearly the same
manner as described by Weismann in Corethra. We give the following
condensed account of Gonin’s observations.</p>

<p class='c007'>On opening a caterpillar entering on the semipupa state (Fig. 605),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>the relative position of the germs (imaginal buds or folds) of the
wings and of the legs are seen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These imaginal buds in a more advanced stage are seen in our
sections of a tineid larva (Figs. 606, 607).</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of 12 imaginal buds found by Weismann in the
thorax of Muscidæ does not occur in Lepidoptera, since, as in the
Hymenoptera (Bugnion), the dorsal buds of the prothoracic segment
are wanting. Gonin finds in Pieris that the ventral buds of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>three thoracic segments are each represented by several distinct
folds attached to the femoro-tibial bud and to the tarsal joints.</p>

<p class='c007'>The imaginal buds serve in some cases for the formation of new
organs (wings, legs of insects with apodous larvæ); in others for
the growth and the transformation of organs already existing (legs,
antennæ, 1st and 2d maxillæ of Lepidoptera).</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the peripodal sac or hypodermic envelope which contains the imaginal
bud, a portion persists and is regenerated, while the other part becomes useless
and is detached under the form of débris, as shown by Weismann, Viallanes,
and Van Rees in the Muscidæ. On this point Gonin disagrees with Dewitz,
who stated that the walls of the wing-sacs are not destroyed, but are only gradually
withdrawn at the time of pupation, in order to allow the orifice to distend
and let the wing pass out to the exterior.</p>

<p class='c013'>The portion of the sac which persists (basal portion, peripheral pad of Bugnion,
or annular zone of Künckel) serves at first to attach the appendage, while forming,
to the hypodermis of the larva, then afterwards to more or less completely
regenerate the adjoining portion of the integument. In this way the hypodermis
of the thorax is partially, that of the head is almost entirely, replaced by the
imaginal epithelium which proliferates at the base of the appendages,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> while that
of the abdominal segments persists, at least in a modified way, and only undergoes
(at the end of the pupal period) transformations as regards the appearance
of the scales and pigment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The wings.</b>—The imaginal buds of the wings do not participate
in the larval moults. Gonin has observed, contrary to Dewitz, that
their surface only forms a cuticle towards the end of the last larval
stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The network of fine tracheæ of the wing-bud is drawn out at
the time of pupation with the internal cuticle of the large tracheæ.
The permanent tracheæ of the wing have already appeared at the
time of the 3d moult under the form of large rectilinear trunks, the
position of which corresponds afterwards to that of the veins, but
they are not filled with air until the time of pupation. There are
from eight to ten of these tracheæ in each wing (Fig. 159), and they
give rise in the pupa to a new system of fine tracheæ (tracheoles)
which replaces that of the larva. (For further details the reader is
referred to pp. 126–137.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Development of the feet and the cephalic appendages.</b><a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a>—In the apodous
larvæ of Diptera and Hymenoptera the rudiments of the legs are,
like those of the wings, developed within hypodermal sacs; at
times they remain there up to the end of larval life, but sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>they appear early at the surface. This origin of the legs, thanks to
Weismann, Künckel, and Van Rees, is well known in the Diptera;
in the Hymenoptera it has been proved to be the case with ants by
Dewitz, and in Encyrtus by Bugnion. As for the Lepidoptera our
knowledge that the legs of the imago arise from the six thoracic
legs of the caterpillar, up to the date of Gonin’s paper has not been
in advance of that of Malpighi and Swammerdam.</p>

<p class='c013'>Réaumur, moreover, was supposed to have furnished the proof, having from
his experiments concluded that “if the legs of the pupa appear longer and larger
than those of the caterpillar wherein they were contained, it is because they
were folded and squeezed.” (8<sup>e</sup> Mém., p. 365.)</p>

<p class='c013'>This explanation of Réaumur’s has been generally accepted. Graber (Die
Insekten, p. 506) accepted it, after examining microscopic sections of the legs,
and Künckel averred that “Réaumur, having, in certain caterpillars, completely
cut off one of the thoracic legs, had concluded that the butterfly which came
from it lacked the corresponding member.” (Rech. sur l’org. et dév. des volucelles,
p. 160.)</p>

<p class='c013'>Newport, it is true, denied this disappearance of the legs, but did not wish to
put himself in opposition to received ideas, and supposed that the member cut
off was partly reformed in the imago.</p>

<p class='c013'>Künckel believes that he has found a better solution in his theory of histoblasts
or imaginal buds; in his opinion, “Réaumur and Newport are both right,”
but “when Réaumur cut off a caterpillar’s leg, he at the same time removed the
histoblast, the rudiment of the leg of the butterfly. When Newport repeated
this experiment, he simply mutilated the histoblast without completely destroying
it: in the first case, the adult insect was born with one leg less; in the
second case, it appeared with an atrophied foot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So ingenious an explanation,” says Gonin, “is not necessary.” To prove
that the experiments of the two savants are not contradictory, it would have
been sufficient to cite, as Künckel did not do, the exact words of Réaumur, for he
having cut from a caterpillar “more than half of three of the thoracic legs on
the same side,” says he found that the chrysalis had “the three limbs on one
side <i>shorter</i> than the corresponding ones on the other side.” The same operation
repeated on a somewhat younger caterpillar again showed in the chrysalis
three maimed limbs, “so that they could not be said to be entirely absent. These
results are like those of Newport; the interpretation only was faulty, as we
shall attempt to prove.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The real relations of the adult legs to the larval legs are thus
shown by Gonin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we carefully strip off the skin of a caterpillar near the time of
pupation (Fig. 608), we see that the extremity only of the legs of the
imago is drawn out of the larval legs; the other parts are pressed
against each side of the thorax: near the ventral line a small pad
represents the coxa and the trochanter; the femur and the tibia are
distinctly recognizable, but soldered to each other and only separated
by a slight furrow; they form by their union a very acute knee or
bend. The femur is movable on the pad-like coxa, the tibia continues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>without precise limits with the extremity concealed in the larval
legs. The three divisions of the latter do not appear to have any
relation with the live joints of the perfect state. Under the microscope
the rudiment appears very strongly plaited at the level of the
tarsus, much less so in the other regions. A large trachea penetrates
into the femur with some capillaries; reaching the knee it bends into
the tibia at a sharp curve, but does not become truly sinuous in
approaching the extremity. It is then the tarsus especially which
is susceptible of elongation; it may, on being withdrawn, give rise
to the illusion that the whole organ is disengaged from the larval
leg.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This disposition is, we believe, not known. It gives the key to
the experiments of Réaumur and of Newport.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even when we cut off the limb of the caterpillar at its base, we
only remove the tarsus of the imago; the femur and the tibia remain
intact. From an evident homology Réaumur has erroneously concluded
that there is an identity. His opinion, classical up to this
day, that the limb of the butterfly is entirely contained in the leg of
the caterpillar, has been found to be inexact and should be abandoned.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Embryonic cells and the phagocytes.</b>—Up to the last larval stage the
legs do not offer, says Gonin, any vestige of an imaginal germ, but
they contain a great number of embryonic cells (Fig. 145, <i>ec</i>). They
are almost always collected around a nerve or trachea; sometimes
they are independent, and sometimes retained in the peritoneal
sheath, seeming to arise by proliferation from this sheath. Some
thus contribute to the lengthening of the tracheal branches or nerves,
and the others, becoming detached, form leucocytes or phagocytes.
They are very numerous in the legs, at the beginning of the 4th stage,
but are disseminated some days later throughout the whole cavity
of the body. At the time of histolysis they attack the larval tissues
and increase in volume at their expense; in return they serve for
the nutrition of the imaginal parts and exercise no destructive action
on them. Van Rees agrees with Kowalevsky in comparing these
attacks of the embryonic cells, sometimes victorious and sometimes
impotent, to the war which the leucocytes wage against both the
attenuated and the virulent bacteria.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the femur and of the tibia, transformation of the tarsus.</b>—Capillary
tracheæ appear in the leg at the same time as in the
wing. They arise from the end of a tracheal trunk near the base of
the limb on the dorsal and convex side. After the 3d moult the
hypodermis thickens near this place; in a few days a pad is formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>there and then a large imaginal bud with a circular invagination.
These buds were noticed by Lyonet, who supposed them to be
“les principes des jambes de la phalène.” Nerves and a tracheal
branch penetrate into the femoro-tibial bud and form a small bay or
constriction which marks the point of junction of the femur with
the tibia, and the body-cavity remains in direct communication with
the end of the limb.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The tarsus undergoes a series of changes; the surface is folded in
a very complicated way; at the level of each articulation, but only
in the internal and concave region of the leg, is developed a deep
fold; on one side there is a hypodermic
thickening, on the other a simple leaf
of the envelope, which afterwards joins
at its base with the parietal hypodermis, and then two leaves are
destroyed with the large cells of the setæ. The internal part and
end of the tarsus are then reconstituted with the elimination of the
débris, while the external and convex region undergoes direct
regeneration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coxa and trochanter are derived from the base of the larval
leg, and only the 1st pair are well separated from the base of the
thorax. One or two days before pupation the femoro-tibial bud, after
having, until now, preserved its antero-posterior direction, is placed
transversely as regards the larva, then becoming directed obliquely
forward. This rotatory movement of the coxa may be attributed to
the great extension of the fore wings, which push before them the
two first pairs of legs. The last pair in their turn are simply covered
by the hind wings and are but slightly displaced. This new position
of the legs is that of the imago: the knee of the 1st pair is situated
in front of the tarsus; that of the 2d a little outward; that of
the 3d pair is directed backward. (Gonin.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The antennæ.</b>—These appendages also have the same relation with
those of the caterpillar as in the case of the legs, the larval appendages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>being only the point of departure of the imaginal growth.
Weismann has observed in Corethra how at the approach of each
moult an invagination like the finger of a glove allows the antenna
to elongate from its base. The process, says Gonin, is identical in
the caterpillar of Pieris. At the last
moult the invagination is so pronounced
that it is not effaced with the renewal
of the chitinous integument. Several
days later it again begins to grow larger.
As the imaginal bud gradually sinks
into the cavity of the head, it presses
back the hypodermic wall and thus
forms an envelope around it. Its base,
widely opened, gives admission to the
nerves, besides capillaries and sometimes
a large trachea.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As soon as it reaches the posterior
region of the head, the antenna in
lengthening becomes folded and describes the great curves which
led Réaumur to compare it to a ram’s horn (Fig. 613). The leaf of
the envelope thickens in the interior and all around the base of the
organ. Its ultimate rôle is closely like that of the two other hypodermic
formations. It is at the outset this layer of cells which in
the larva supports the ocelli. This layer, hidden on each side under
the parietal region, thickens and regenerates, forming a circular pad
which becomes more prominent and finally assumes the form of the
compound eye of the imago.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Finally, this layer gives rise to a conical prolongation (Fig. 612, <i>c</i>),
which after exuviation appears as a tuft of long hairs, and is called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>by Gonin the crest (cimier, Fig. 612), which is characteristic of
the pupæ of Pieridæ. It is only differentiated towards the end
of the 4th larval stage in a median depression of the vertex. It is
an imaginal bud in the
most general sense of the
word.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On each side the base of
the antenna comes in contact
with the germ of the
crest. The envelopes approach
each other, and their
thickened part constitutes
with the ocular disks a new
cephalic wall. The head of
the butterfly thus marked
off is triangular; all the
larval parts remaining out
of this area then disappear.
The muscles and the nerves are resorbed by histolysis, then the
external part of the imaginal envelopes and the old parietal hypodermis,
reduced very thin and degenerated, is detached in shreds.
The antenna becomes external throughout its whole extent. The
transformation is in this case, then, almost as complete as in the
thorax of Diptera or Hymenoptera. It is necessitated by the change
of form and of volume of the head. The region of the ocelli persists
unchanged almost alone from the larva to the imago also. The
limit is not well marked between the portion which is the replacement
or direct renovation of the epithelium.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Maxilla and labial palpi.</b>—The development of the tongue (1st
maxillæ) is so like that of the antennæ that it scarcely needs description.
Beginning at the last moult, the hypodermic contents of the
maxillæ is withdrawn in the cephalic cavity under the form of a
hollow bud whose base is turned inward. The invagination remains
less distinct than in the antennæ; it does not even reach to the
anterior part of the œsophagus. The two symmetrical halves of the
tongue approach each other and are thrice folded. When the caterpillar
stops feeding, they each curve in in the form of an S, remaining
lodged under the floor of the mouth (Fig. 613, <i>t</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Underneath are to be seen two other buds, which by an identical
process become the labial palpi (Figs. 614, 615, <i>p</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>At the anterior part of the head, where the organs are very close
together, the envelopes form several folds without any further use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>(Fig. 615, <i>r</i>). The two leaves then fuse together and decay as at
the surface of the tarsus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, in the mandibles and the labrum, there is only a cellular
thickening without any invagination.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><b>Process of pupation.</b>—Notwithstanding the great number of persons
who have reared Lepidoptera, close and patient observations as
to the exact details are still needed. Gonin, who has made the
closest observations on Pieris, pertinently asks why the antennæ,
which are appendages of the head, are visible in the abdominal
region, and why the tongue (maxillæ) is extended between the legs
as far as the 3d abdominal segment. To answer these questions he
made a series of experiments. Selecting some caterpillars which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>were about to pupate, he produced an artificial metamorphosis by
removing the cuticula in small bits. Exposing the appendages in
this way, they preserved the position which they are seen to take
during growth. Each wing appeared within the limits of the segment
from which it grew out (Fig. 610), not extending beyond,
as it does in the normal pupa, so that Réaumur was wrong in saying
that “the wings are here gathered on each side into a kind of band,
which is large enough to lie in the cavity which is between the 1st
and 2d segment.” (8<sup>e</sup> Mém., p. 359.)</p>

<p class='c007'>All these parts are coated with a viscous fluid secreted by special
glands, which hardens after pupation upon exposure to the air. So
long as the parts are soft, they can easily be displaced. Gonin drew
one of the antennæ like a collar around the head, and one half of
the tongue upon the outer side of the wing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When pupation is normal, the integument splits open on the back
of the thorax, and the pupa draws itself from before backwards.
Owing to the feeble adherence which the chitinous secretion gives it,
it draws along with it the underlying organs. The legs, antennæ,
the two halves of the tongue (maxillæ) retained by their end, each
in a small chitinous case, can only disengage themselves from it
when in elongating they have acquired a sufficient tension. The
curves straighten out and the folds unbend. The chitinous mask of
the head in withdrawing from the larval skin follows the ventral
line; the tongue and labial palpi free themselves from its median
part; the antennæ disengage themselves from the two lateral scales.
Between these different appendages a space is left on the surface of
the head for the eyes, and on the thorax for the legs. These are
not completely extended on account of the lack of freedom of the
femoro-tibial articulation; the femur preserves its direction from
behind forwards, and the knee in the two first pairs remains at the
same height. The wings overlie them and cover the under side of
the two basal abdominal segments; their surfaces in becoming
united increase much in size.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the chitinous frame of each spiracle gradually detaches itself,
we see a tuft of tracheæ passing out of the orifice. It is at this
moment that the provisional tracheal system is cast off, and it is
easy to see that the process is facilitated by the simultaneous elongation
of all the appendages. The permanent tracheæ can follow
this elongation because they are sinuous, and need only to straighten
their curves. It is, however, not the same with the tracheoles, as
we have seen in the case of the wings (p. 133), and their extension
or stretching is thus explained by a very simple mechanism.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>“The position which the organs assume in the chrysalis is not due to chance,
everything is determined in advance, and the microscope shows us that the
structure of the hypodermis is specially modified in all the parts which remain
external. It is a fact well known to those who rear Lepidoptera that if this
normal arrangement is disturbed there are few chances that the perfect insect
will survive. A leg lifted up, or an antenna displaced, leaves a surface illy protected
against external influences. Almost always this accident causes a drying
of the chrysalis.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Several interesting experiments may be cited as bearing on this subject.
If during transformation the chitinous mask of the head is separated from the
integument beneath, it is arrested half-way in its development, and the antennæ
and tongue are not fully extended. When the case or skin of the caterpillar is
drawn, not from before backward, but in the opposite direction, all the appendages
of the thorax are placed perpendicularly to the body. Dewitz and Künckel
d’Herculais, in stating that the skin of the caterpillar splits open along its whole
length, show that they were ignorant of the mechanism; for it is precisely because
the chitinous larval skin splits open only in front that it preserves sufficient
adherence to the organs beneath to draw them after it in the direction of
the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To only read modern authors, one would suppose that the mechanism of
pupation had remained hitherto unknown. In reality, it did not escape the
notice of Swammerdam or of Réaumur, both of whom have described it with
care. The first attached too much importance to the flow of blood, the action
of which would be rather to push the organs out than to extend them over the
surface of the thorax; the second insists on the movements of the insect. This
factor, very admissible in caterpillars, ‘whose under side is situated on a
horizontal plane’ (iii, 9<sup>e</sup> Mémoire, p. 395), cannot be invoked for those which
suspend themselves by the tail, as in the genus Vanessa.” (Gonin.)</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>b.</i> The Hymenoptera</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the Hymenoptera, Ratzeburg was the first to figure and describe
the numerous intermediate stages between the larva and pupa, his
subjects being the ants, Cynips, and Cryptus, which pass through
five stadia before assuming the final pupal shape.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the bees, as we have observed in the larvæ of Bombus (Proc.
Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., 1866), after hardening a series in alcohol of
young in different stages of development, it will be found difficult to
draw the line between the different stages since they shade insensibly
into each other, those represented in Fig. 616 being selected stages.
The head of the incipient semipupa distends the prothoracic segment
of the larva whose head is pushed forward and the thoracic
segments are much elongated, while the appendages and wings are
well developed, and have assumed the shape of those of the pupa.
Development both in the head and thorax begins in the most important
central parts, and proceeds outwards to the periphery.
During this period the “median segment,” or 1st abdominal, has
begun to pass forward and to form a part of the thorax.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id063'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>
<img src='images/i_686.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 616.</span>—Transformation of the bumblebee, Bombus, showing the transfer of the 1st abdominal larval segment (<i>c</i>) to the thorax, forming the propodeum of the pupa (<i>D</i>) and imago: <i>n</i>, spiracle of the propodeum. <i>A</i>, larva; <i>a</i>, head; <i>b</i>, 1st thoracic, <i>c</i>, 1st abdominal, segment. <i>B</i>, semipupa; <i>g</i>, antenna; <i>h</i>, maxillæ; <i>i</i>, 1st, <i>j</i>, 2d leg; <i>k</i>, mesoscutum. <i>l</i>, mesoscutellum; <i>m</i>, metathorax; <i>d</i>, urite (sternite of abdomen); <i>e</i>, pleurite; <i>f</i>, tergite; <i>o</i>, ovipositor; <i>r</i>, lingua; <i>q</i>, maxilla.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In what may be termed the 3d stage (Fig. 616, <i>C</i>), though the
distinction is a very arbitrary one, the change is accompanied by a
moulting of the skin, and a great advance has been made towards
assuming the pupal form. The abdomen is very distinctly separated
from the thorax, the propodeum being closely united with the thorax,
and the head and thorax taken together are nearly as large as the
abdomen, the latter now being shorter and perceptibly changed in
form, more like that of the completed pupa, while there are other
most important changes in the elaboration of the parts of the thorax,
particularly the tergites, and of the head and its appendages. Meanwhile
the ovipositor has been completed and nearly withdrawn
within the end of the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next to study the transformations of the Hymenoptera was
Ganin, who discovered the early remarkable pre-eruciform larvæ, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>we may call them, of certain egg-parasites (Proctotrypidæ). He
discovered the imaginal buds of the wings in the third larva of
Polynema (Fig. 185), but his observations, and those of Ayers, need
not detain us here, as they have little to do with the subject of the
normal metamorphosis of the Hymenoptera, and will be discussed
under the subject of Hypermetamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>To Bugnion we owe the first detailed account of the internal
changes in the Hymenoptera, his observations being made on a
chalcid parasite, <i>Encyrtus fuscicollis</i>, a parasite of Hyponomeuta.
The apodous larva (Fig. 618) moults but once, the next ecdysis
being at the time of pupation. It passes through a semipupal stage.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Bugnion observed in the larva of Encyrtus three pairs of lower
thoracic or pedal imaginal buds, two pairs of upper or alary buds, a
pair of ocular or oculo-cephalic buds
destined to build up all the posterior
part of the head, a pair of antennal
buds, and three pairs of buds of the
genital armature (ovipositor). He also
detected the rudiments of the buccal
appendages under the form of six small
buds (Fig. 619), which do not invaginate,
and are not surrounded by a
semicircular pad. Also in the abdomen,
behind each pair of stigmata,
there is a group of hypodermic cells
(Fig. 617), which, without doubt, correspond
to the wing-buds, but are not
differentiated into a central bud and
its pad, and does not merit the name of imaginal bud. In fact,
except the eye-buds, which are unlike the others, he only observed
the imaginal buds of the legs, wings, and ovipositor. The antennal
buds are, like those of the buccal appendages, without an annular
zone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pedal buds were detected in the middle of larval life. They
each form a central bud surrounded by a circular thickening. They
gradually elongate and become tongue-like and somewhat bent; soon
a linear opening or slit appears, forming the mouth of a cavity
which communicates with that of the body, allowing the passage
into them of the tracheæ, muscles, and nerves, and afterwards of the
blood. Finally, the buds grow longer and slenderer, are bent several
times, and show traces of the articulations; and soon under the
old larval skin, now beginning to rise in anticipation of the moulting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>we see the coxa, femur, tibia, and tarsus of the perfect insect, the
tarsal joints not yet being indicated.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wing-buds (<i>a<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>) appear at the same time as those of the
legs, as racket-shaped masses of small cells situated directly behind
the 1st and 2d pair of stigmata, in contact with the tissue ensheathed
by the corresponding tracheal vesicle (Fig. 618). Afterwards they
have exactly the form of those of the Lepidoptera (Fig. 619).</p>

<p class='c007'>The proliferation of the hypodermis is not limited to the thorax,
but takes place at corresponding points in the first seven abdominal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>segments. These abdominal agglomerations of cells do not give
rise to true buds, but serve simply to reconstitute the hypodermis
of the abdominal segments at the time of metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ocular or oculo-cephalic buds.</b>—The eye of insects, as is well known,
is a modification of a portion of the integument, the visual cells
being directly derived from the hypodermis, the cornea being a
cuticular product of this last, like chitinous formations in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ocular buds appear towards the end of larval life as a simple
mass of hypodermic cells, and form a compact layer on the dorsolateral
face of the prothoracic segment, and clothe the cephalic
ganglion or brain like a skull-cap. The central portion only is
destined to form the eye, while the peripheral pad, continuing to
thicken, gives rise to a voluminous and rounded mass, which meets
on the median line that of the opposite side, and forms the integument
of all the posterior part of the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bugnion also observed on the median line a group of small hypodermic
cells which he regarded as the rudiment of the anterior
ocellus, but he did not detect those of the posterior ocelli.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The antennal buds.</b>—These appear at an early date under the
cuticle of the head, as two distinct rounded cellular masses, with a
central cavity, but no annular zone (Fig. 619, <i>f</i>). Each one grows
longer in a transverse sense, and its summit, extended from the outer
side, curves downward. It now forms a hollow tube folded at the
end, and terminated by a disk whose centre is perforated (Fig. 619, <i>f</i>).
Afterwards, when the larva is ready to transform, it grows longer,
becomes folded on itself in its cavity, and, passing beyond on each
side the limits of the larval head, encroaches on the prothoracic
segment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The buds of the buccal appendages.</b>—Towards the end of the larval
period, the buds of the mouth-parts appear as small digitiform projections,
situated on each side and below the mouth. Formed of
small epithelial cells pressed against each other, they are all directed
anteriorly, and possess no furrow or pad.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 2d maxillæ (labium) is formed of two separate parts. The
imaginal buds of the lower lip appear on each side of the median
line, with a fissure indicating the differentiation of the palpus. On
each side are to be seen the 1st maxillary buds, bearing each a rudimentary
palpus, and, farther in front, the buds of the mandibles.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The buds of the ovipositor.</b>—The six stylets of the ovipositor
arise from six small imaginal buds which become visible in the
second half of the larval period, on each side of the median line,
on the lower face of the three last segments (Fig. 620, <i>q<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>q<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>q<sup>3</sup></i>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>The bud is differentiated into a central discoidal bud, a furrow, and
a marginal, rather thick swelling or pad. Afterwards, these buds
elongate and form
small papilliform projections
directed backwards
(Fig. 621); but
only during the pupal
period do they, as
already observed in
Bombus, approach each
other and assume their
definite shape as an
ovipositor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, Bugnion
states that while metamorphosis
in the Hymenoptera
is less highly
modified than in the
Muscidæ, it is more
marked than in the
Coleoptera and Lepidoptera.
In these orders
the pupa moves the
abdomen, but in Hymenoptera
it is absolutely
immovable
throughout pupal life,
as long as the integument
is soft.</p>

<h3 class='c002'>DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMAGO IN THE DIPTERA</h3>
<p class='c006'>The flies, particularly the Muscidæ and their allies (Brachycera),
are the most highly modified of insects, their larvæ having undergone
the greatest amount of reduction and loss of limbs, this
atrophy involving even most of the head. The following account
has been prepared in part from the works of Weismann, Ganin,
Miall, and Pratt, but mostly from the excellent general summarized
account given by Korschelt and Heider.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the holometabolic orders of insects, with their resting pupal
stage, during which no food is taken, the entire activity of life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>seems to be turned to deep-seated and complicated internal developmental
processes. These inner changes involve an almost complete
destruction of many organs of the larva, and their renewal from
certain germs (the imaginal buds) already present in the larva, as
will be seen in the highly modified Muscidæ. Only a few larval
organs become directly transferred into the body of the pupa and
imago. Such are the rudiments of the genital system. The heart
also, and the central portion of the nervous system, suffer only
slight and unimportant, almost trivial, internal changes. On the
other hand, most of the other organs of the larva become completely
destroyed: the hypodermis, most of the muscles, the entire
digestive canal with the salivary glands; while their cells, under the
influence of the blood corpuscles (leucocytes), which here act as
phagocytes, fall into pieces, which are taken up by them and become
digested. Simultaneously with this destructive, histolytic process,
the new formation of the organs by the imaginal buds, already
indicated in the embryo, is accomplished in such a way that the
continuity of the organs in most cases remains unimpaired. This
process of transformation can only be understood by considering
that of the embryonal germs of the organs, (1) only a part is destined
for the use of the larva in growth, and for the performance of
certain functions which exhaust themselves during larval life, so
that it is no more capable of farther transformation, and finally
becomes destroyed; while (2) a second part of the embryonal germs
or rudiments persists first in an undeveloped condition, as imaginal
buds, in order to undertake during the pupa stage the regeneration
of the organs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though Swammerdam knew that the rudiments of the wings were already
present under the skin of the larvæ, we are indebted, for our present knowledge,
to the thorough and profound investigations of Weismann on the metamorphosis
of the Diptera, and also to the researches of Ganin and others who have worked
on the pupæ of Muscidæ, in which the development is most complicated and
modified. In the more generalized and primitive Diptera, such as Corethra, the
processes of formation of the pupa and imago are much simpler than in the
muscids and Pupipara. These processes are still simpler in the Lepidoptera and
Hymenoptera, and for this reason we have given a summary of what has been
done on these organs by Newport, Dewitz, and especially by Bugnion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our knowledge of this subject is still very imperfect, only the more salient
points having been worked out, and, as Korschelt and Heider state, there is still
lacking certain proof as to how far the relations of the internal changes known
to exist in the Muscidæ also apply to other orders of insects, though it must be
considered that in the pupa of Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, perhaps also the
Coleoptera, and we would add in the Neuroptera as well as the male Coccidæ,
very similar metamorphic processes take place.</p>

<p class='c016'>The form of the imago is completely marked out in the pupa, so
that the transition from the pupa to the imago is comparatively
slight and only depends on the modification and development of the
parts already present.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In most cases the modification in question consists of the changes
occurring during the passage from the larval form to the imago, the
reformation of parts already present being most marked, while the
new rudiments only participate in a limited way in the process.
Thus, for example, the head of the caterpillar together with the
antennæ and mouth-parts, also the thoracic limbs, pass directly and
unchanged from the larva into the pupa. The compound eyes and
the wings are, however,
new formations, the
latter arising from imaginal
buds. The same
is the case with many
other Heterometabola,
where the passage of the
larva into the pupa in
general is due to a transformation
of parts already
present. The
changes in the brain,
the fusion of certain ganglia of the ventral nervous cord, the
changes in the abdomen, involving the reduction in the number of
segments and the remodelling of the end of the body, and the formation
of the ovipositor or sting, and in the higher Hymenoptera
the transfer of the 1st abdominal segment to the thorax, and the
origin of the genital armature,—all these should here be taken
into account.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be observed that in every case where the larvæ are footless,
as in Diptera, all the Hymenoptera except the phytophagous
ones and certain coleopterous larvæ, the limbs of the imago stage
are, in the earliest stages, indicated as new structures in the form of
imaginal buds.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the imago in Corethra.</b>—Corethra may serve as
an example of such a relatively simple metamorphosis. Its larva
belongs to the group of eucephalous dipterous larvæ. The head of
the perfect insect is already indicated in the larva, and its parts,
with certain modifications, pass directly into the pupa. The compound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>eyes, and this is a rare exception among the Holometabola,
are present in the larva. On the other hand, the thoracic legs, the
wings, and halteres are developed out of new rudiments which are
present in the last larval stage, before
pupation. Each thoracic segment has
four of them, two ventral and two
dorsal (Fig. 622); the ventral buds
becoming the legs. Of the dorsal
pairs, that of the mesothorax develops
into wings, that of the metathorax
into halteres, while from the corresponding
rudiments of the prothorax
in Corethra arise the stigma-bearing
dorsal or respiratory processes of the
pupa, and in Simulium a tuft of
tracheal gills (Fig. 623, <i>ra</i>; see also
Fig. 582).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These imaginal buds may be regarded
as evaginations of the outer
surface of the body. The only difference
is that the buds of the appendages
as a whole seem sunken below
the level of the surface of the body,
being situated at the bottom of an evagination, as in the buds of
the head and trunk in the Pilidium larva of nemertean worms, and
in the rudiments of the lower surface of
the body of Echinus present in the pluteus
larva.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lumen of the invagination in which
the appendages of Corethra (and other Holometabola)
are situated is called by Van
Rees the <i>peripodal cavity</i>, and the external
sheath bordering it, which is naturally continuous
with the hypodermis of the body,
the <i>peripodal membrane</i> (Fig. 636, <i>p</i>).</p>

<p class='c013'>We must adopt the view that the rudiments of
the appendages (imaginal buds) are from the first
divided into ectodermal and mesodermal portions,
which are derived from the corresponding germ-layers
of the larva. The ectoderm of the rudiments
of the appendages is continuous with the peripodal membrane, and
through it with the hypodermis. Weismann was inclined to derive the organs
(tracheæ, muscles, etc.) developing within the germs of the appendages from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>hypertrophy of the neurilemma of a nerve passing down from within into
the imaginal bud, and held that nerves and tracheal branches soon after passed
into the inner surface of the imaginal bud. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c007'>When the imaginal buds of the appendages enlarge, then the
peripodal membranes become correspondingly distended, and the
limbs within assume a more or less crumpled position, and in Corethra
are spirally twisted, while the rudiments of the wings are
folded. The completion of the rudimentary limbs is accomplished
simply by their passing out of the invagination in which they originated.
The limbs thus gradually become free, the peripodal membrane
is seen to reach the level of the rest of the hypodermis and
become a part of it, and the base of the extremity is no longer
situated in a cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The internal organs of Corethra undergo but to a slight degree
the destruction (histolysis) which is so thoroughgoing in the Muscidæ.
Kowalevsky states that in the mid-intestine of Corethra a histolysis
of the larval and reconstruction of the imaginal epithelium goes on
in the same way as has been described in Musca. Most of the
larval organs pass without histolytic changes directly over into those
of the pupal and imaginal stages; the muscles in general are also
unchanged, but those of the appendages and wings are made over
anew. The last arise, according to Weismann, in the last larval
stage from strings of cells which are already present in the
embryo.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we consider how insignificant the internal transformations
are during the metamorphosis of the Tipulidæ, of which Corethra
serves as an example, we can scarcely doubt that we here have
before us conditions which illustrate the passage between an incomplete
and a complete metamorphosis. Thus, among other things,
should be mentioned the short duration of the pupa stage and the
activity of the pupa, as also the early appearance of the germs of
the compound eyes, a character which Corethra has in common
with the Hemimetabola. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the imago in Culex.</b>—In respect to the formation of
the imaginal head, Culex is still more primitive than Corethra.
Miall and Hammond find from Hurst’s partly unpublished descriptions
and preparations that there are no deep invaginations for the
compound eyes or antennæ of the imago.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The compound eye forms beneath the larval eye-spots, and is at first relatively
simple and composed of few facets. The number increases by the gradual
formation of partial and marginal invaginations, each of which forms a new
element. The imaginal antenna grows to a much greater length than that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>the larval antenna, and its base is accordingly telescoped into the head, while
the shaft becomes irregularly folded.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Culex, though more modified than
Chironomus in many respects, <i>e.g.</i> in the mouth-parts, is relatively primitive
with respect to the formation of the imaginal head, and shows a mode of
development of the eye and antenna which we may suppose to have characterized
a remote and comparatively unspecialized progenitor of Chironomus.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the imago in Chironomus.</b>—The development of the
head of the imago of <i>Chironomus dorsalis</i> has been discussed by
Miall and Hammond. The invaginations which give rise to the head
of the fly could not be discovered even in a rudimentary state until
after the last larval moult.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Weismann has given reasons for supposing that invaginated imaginal rudiments
could not come into existence before the last larval moult in an insect
whose life-history resembles that of Corethra or Chironomus. If the epidermis
were invaginated in any stage before the ante-pupal one, the new cuticle,
moulded closely upon the epidermis, would become invaginated also, and would
appear at the next moult with projecting appendages like those of a pupa or
imago. This is actually the way in which the wings are developed in some
larval insects with incomplete metamorphosis. In Muscidæ the invaginations
for the head of the imago have been traced back to the embryo within the egg,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
but the almost total subsequent separation of the disks from the epidermis
renders their development independent of the growth of the larval cuticle and of
the moults that probably take place therein.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pupal and imaginal cuticles do not follow at all closely the
larval skin, but, says Miall, become at particular places folded far
into the interior. “The folds which give rise to the head of the fly
are two in number and paired. They begin at the larval antenna on
each side of the head, and gradually extend further and further
backwards. The object of the folds is to provide an extended surface
which can be moulded, without pressure from surrounding objects,
into the form of the future head. On one part of each fold
the facets of the large compound eyes are developed; another part
gives rise to the future antenna, a large and elaborate organ, which
springs from the bottom of the fold, and whose tip just enters the
very short antenna of the larva. The folds for the head ultimately
become so large that the larval head cannot contain them, and they
extend far into the prothorax. Here a difficulty occurs. If the
generating cuticle of the prothorax were also to be folded inwards,
the future prothorax would take a corresponding shape. But the
prothorax of the fly has a form dictated to it by the limbs which it
bears and by the muscles to which it gives attachment. These call
for a great reduction in its length, and a peculiar shape, which it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>not here necessary to describe. It will be enough to realize that
the epidermis of the future prothorax cannot be sacrificed to the
folds which are to give rise to the head of the fly. All interference
between the two developing structures is obviated by the provision
of a transverse fold, which pushes into the prothorax from the neck,
and forms a sort of internal pocket. The floor of the pocket forms
two longitudinal folds, which prolong the folds originating in the
larval head. The roof of the pocket shrinks up and forms the
connection between the head and thorax of the fly. Ultimately
the head-part is drawn out, leaving the prothoracic structures
unaffected.”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The development of the head of the fly of Chironomus appears, as
Miall and Hammond state, to be intermediate between the groups
Adiscota and Discota of Weismann; <i>i.e.</i> “between the types in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>which the parts of the head of the fly are developed in close relation
to those of the larva, and the types in which deep invaginations
lead apparently to the formation of similar new parts far within
the body, the seeming independence of the new parts being intensified
by thoroughgoing histolysis,” and they suggest that possibly
types may be discovered intermediate between Chironomus and
Muscidæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are now prepared to consider the extremely complicated
changes, in the Muscidæ, leaving out of consideration the origin of
the wings from imaginal
buds, which has already
been discussed on pp.
126–137.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Formation of the imago
in Muscidæ.</b><a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a>—In the
flesh, and undoubtedly
the house, and allied flies
the germs or imaginal
buds of the legs and
wings arise in the same
way as in Corethra. But
in the Muscidæ, the buds
are situated far within the
interior of the body, the
peripodal cavities appear
closed, and the peripodal
membrane stands in connection
with the hypodermis
merely by means
of a delicate thread-like
stalk. This connecting
cord, which was first detected
by Dewitz, and
whose interpretation was
entirely right, shows in its interior, as Van Rees proved, a narrow
cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the earliest stages in the development of imaginal buds
in the embryo of the Muscidæ are still unknown, yet we shall not
go far astray if we refer them, like the imaginal buds of Corethra,
to hypodermal invaginations. We must, then, regard the stalk-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_674'>674</span>connection just mentioned as the long drawn-out neck of this
invagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, the development of the appendages (Figs. 626, 627)
goes on as described in Corethra. The rudiments of the legs enlarge
and show at an early date the first traces of the later joints. They
are so packed in the peripodal cavities that the single joints of
the extremities appear as if pushed in “like the joints of a travelling
cup.” (Van Rees.) The evagination of the completely formed buds
of the limbs, which occurs on the first day after the beginning of
pupation, goes on in such a way that the stalk of the imaginal bud
(Figs. 626, <i>B</i>; 627, <i>B</i>) shortens, while its cavity widens so that the
limbs finally, as in Corethra, pass out through the widely opened
mouth of the peripodal invagination, which at the same time gradually
completely disappears. The peripodal membrane is converted
into a thickened part of the hypodermis in the region adjoining the
base of the leg, and from this thickened hypodermal portion, the
formation of the hypodermis of the entire imaginal thorax goes on,
as the larval hypodermis is gradually destroyed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We must here settle the question as to the first origin of the mesodermal
portions of the rudiments of the appendages. We can already distinguish in
the imaginal buds of the fully grown muscid larva a clear separation between
an ectodermal and an inner mesodermal part. Ganin derived the mesodermal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>part through a sort of differentiation and separation of the innermost layer
of the ectodermal part, and Van Rees has, in general, confirmed this view.
Kowalevsky, on the other hand, is inclined to the view that the mesodermal
part of the imaginal bud is derived from the embryonal cells of the mesoderm.
He finds scattered throughout the mesoderm, under the hypodermis of the larva,
so-called wandering cells (Fig. 632, <i>A</i>, <i>w</i>), which are different in appearance
from the leucocytes and from the elements from which the formation of the
mesodermal parts of the imaginal rudiments proceed. Kowalevsky is inclined
to believe that there are in each segment rudiments of the imaginal mesoderm,
but which are so delicate and indifferent that we cannot find them in the first
stages of their origin. From these mesodermal imaginal rudiments the above-mentioned
wandering cells of the mesoderm are derived, which afterwards come
into connection with the ectodermal portion of the imaginal buds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still more complicated and difficult to understand is the development
of the head-section of muscids. We must remember that in
muscid larvæ the head-section exists in its most rudimentary form,
being the result of extreme modification and degeneration. The
small size of the head is also due to the fact that it is more or
less retracted within the thoracic region. Then, as shown by the
researches of Weismann, in the last embryonal stages, the forehead,
mandibles, and the whole region of the head around the mouth
invaginate and form a sunken cavity (Fig. 628, <i>p</i>), in which the
chitinous supports of the hooks characteristic of muscid larvæ are
soon developed. This sunken part of the head, at whose inner end
is the œsophagus, is called by the not entirely appropriate name of
“pharynx,” and it must at present be remembered that the hollow
space thus named is not a part of the digestive canal. It is an invaginated
section of the head, <i>and the formation of the head of the
imago mainly depends on the evagination of this region</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first rudiments of the most important parts of the head (eyes,
antennæ, and forehead), occur in the youngest larvæ as paired masses
of cells which lie in the thorax next to the two halves of the brain
(for this reason called by Weismann “brain-appendages”), which
are from their first origin connected with the pharynx, and may be
regarded as the imaginal buds of the head. These appear very
soon in later stages in the shape of elongated sacs widening at
the hinder end (Fig. 628, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, <i>h</i>), which from their origin are
to be regarded as evaginations of the pharynx. Very soon epithelial
thickenings appear in the wall of this sac-shaped brain-appendage,
in which the rudiments of the parts of the future head may be
recognized.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disk-shaped thickenings in the hinder widened part of the brain-appendage
form the rudiments of the compound eyes, which therefore
may be called the eye-buds. On the basal surface of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>eye-buds is situated a nervous expansion which is connected by a
nerve with the supraœsophageal ganglion. This nerve becomes the
optic nerve of the perfect animal, while the optic ganglion is clearly
separated from the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the anterior, more cylindrical or tube-like part of the brain-appendage
we find the “frontal buds” (<i>ss</i>), on which the antennal
rudiments (<i>at</i>) soon bud out, in exactly the same way as the rudiments
of the limbs arise from the imaginal buds.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Originally (Fig. 628, <i>A</i>) the brain-appendages lie tolerably far
behind in the thorax of the larva, so that they connect the hindermost
part of the wall of the pharynx with the foremost section of
the brain, which they surround in the form of a mushroom. Afterwards,
however, subsequent to pupation, they move, together with
the central nervous system, farther forward (<i>B</i>), whereby they (if
we have correctly understood the descriptions of Weismann and
Van Rees) laterally surround the pharynx with their anterior
end, which is somewhat ventrally bent. At the same time, there
becomes established a gradually widening communication (<i>B</i>, <i>o</i>)
between the brain-appendage and the pharynx, which soon extends
in the form of a lateral pharyngeal fissure along the entire length
of the brain-appendage. As a result, the cavity of the brain-appendage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>and the pharynx so completely unite that the two
soon form a single sac, the head-sac or vesicle (Fig. 6–9, <i>k</i>). The
walls of this head-vesicle are the later head-wall, the most important
parts of which can now be recognized (the antennæ, eyes,
rudiments of the beak). It is now necessary that the head-vesicle
(Fig. 629, +, +) be, by the eversion of the pharynx, turned outward
in order that the head of the pupa may be completed. By
this eversion of invaginated parts, the former mouth-opening of
the pharynx becomes a neck-section (Fig. 629, +, +) by which
head and thorax are now united. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The cause of the eversion of the head-vesicle, which Weismann directly observed,
appears to be due to an increase of the inner pressure through a contraction
of the hinder parts of the body. The anterior end of the œsophagus now
becomes turned down ventrally corresponding to the conformation of the head
of the imago.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been shown that the so-called pharynx is only an invaginated part of
the outer surface of the larval head. The brain-appendage Korschelt and
Heider consider to be the diverticulum of this invagination, in which the single
parts of the body lie in an invaginated state. They may throughout be compared
to the rudiments of the thoracic limbs. All these imaginal buds have been
traced back to the invaginated parts of the outer surface of the body, <i>i.e.</i> the
ectoderm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>It should be borne in mind that the process of development of the
head of the highly-modified Muscidæ is much more complex than in
the more primitive Diptera.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their essay on the development of the head of the imago of
Chironomus, Miall and Hammond arrange the dipterous types
thus far examined, in the order of complexity of the invaginations
which give rise to the head of the imago, in the following order:—</p>

the organs of muscid larvæ (and this applies
to most Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and
Hymenoptera) are destroyed through the
action of leucocytes, and that their reformation
is accomplished by definite groups of
embryonal cells, the imaginal buds or folds.
Destruction and rebuilding occur during the
pupa stage in such a way that in many cases
while this process is going on the continuity
of the organs does not seem to be disturbed.
These transformations especially concern the
hypodermis, the digestive canal, the muscles,
the fat-body, and the salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transformation of the tracheal system
is only partial, being in part a simple process
of regeneration through cell-division.
Slighter changes affect the heart, the central
nervous system, and the reproductive system

<p class='c007'><b>The hypodermis.</b>—The hypodermis of the
imago arises through an extension of the
ectodermal part of the imaginal buds. We
have already mentioned this for the thorax.
As the appendages of the thorax in the pupa
gradually attain perfection, the hypodermis
layer spreads from the place of their insertion, the layer consisting
of numerous small cells whose origin we must refer to the
peripodal membrane. This layer continues to spread over the surface
of the pupal thorax, while at
the same time the area of the
larval hypodermis, consisting of
large cells, is seen to diminish.
Hence the thin edge of the
newly-formed hypodermis (Fig.
631, <i>hi</i>) slowly grows into the
space between the superficial
cuticula and the larval hypodermis
(Fig. 632, <i>h</i>), so that at
this place the old hypodermis
undergoing destruction eventually
lies on the inner side of the
newly-formed epithelial layer (<i>B</i>). We therefore see from this that,
during the replacement of the old hypodermis by the new, the continuity
of the superficial epithelium is never interrupted. Since the
edges of the two kinds of hypodermis overlap, the surface of the
body is nowhere bare of epithelium. The dissolution of the larval
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>hypodermis is accomplished under the influence of the leucocytes
(Fig. 632, <i>k</i>), which attack the larval hypodermis-cells and absorb
their contents piece by piece, and so fill themselves with bits of the
hypodermis-cells and their nuclei; since these fragments have the
shape of roundish granules, they were called by Weismann granule-balls.
These granule-balls, which fill the body-cavity of the later
pupal stage, are nothing else than the leucocytes (blood corpuscles)
which have absorbed the fragments of tissue of the larval body.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should here be said that the destruction of the larval tissues is
not to be attributed to the previous death of the cells, but is the
result of the action of the leucocytes on tissues which, though
weakened in their vital power, are still living. While the completely
healthy, active tissues, <i>i.e.</i> those of the imaginal buds, withstand
the attacks of the leucocytes, the less healthy larval tissues
are by the attacks of the leucocytes divided into fragments and eaten
and digested by them. This process is most marked in the histolysis
of the larval muscles. The destruction of most of the larval
organs depends, therefore, on the capacity of the amœboid blood-corpuscles
for taking food and on intracellular digestion, as was first
shown by Metschnikoff, who has given to these leucocytes the name
of “phagocytes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This process of histolysis goes on in the same way in the head and
abdomen as in the thorax. In the abdomen, as Ganin first proved,
there are in each of the eight segments of which it consists in the
larva four small cellular islets or imaginal buds (Figs. 631, <i>hi</i>,
632, <i>i</i>), from which originate the new hypodermis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Van Rees has lately found in the abdominal segments another
pair of smaller imaginal buds. The four imaginal buds occurring in
the last segment are situated close to each other, encircling the anal
opening (Fig. 633, <i>ims</i>), and take part in the formation of the hind-intestine,
the rectal pouches and rectal papillæ. To this segment
also belong the two pairs of imaginal genital buds (rudiments of
the external sexual organs) which were first found by Künckel
d’Herculais in Volucella.</p>

<p class='c007'>The newly formed hypodermis spreads rapidly over the outer surface
of the body, so that hypodermal areas corresponding to the
separate imaginal buds soon unite. Simultaneously with this completion
of the definite epithelial layer the larval hypodermis becomes
completely destroyed by the phagocytes.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The muscles.</b>—A similar process of destruction by phagocytes
affects the greater number of the larval muscles, except the three
pairs of thoracic muscles employed in respiration, and which pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>intact from the larva to the imago. Indeed, the dissolution of the
muscles is the first process which occurs in the metamorphosis.
The destruction of the larval muscles is accomplished in such a way
that, a great number of leucocytes
which have collected on the surface
of the muscular fibres, press
through the sarcolemma and
enter within the muscular tissue,
filling the spaces formed between
them, By this means the muscles
break up into a number of
rounded particles which are
taken into the interior of the
leucocytes. Thus a collection
of granule-balls arise from the
muscles, which finally separate
from each other and become
scattered throughout the body-cavity
of the pupa. In the same
way as the muscular substance,
the muscle-nuclei are taken up
and digested by the phagocytes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The imaginal muscles develop
from the definitive mesoderm
which has originated from the
mesoderm of the imaginal buds
(Fig. 632, <i>C</i>, <i>m</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The digestive canal.</b>—As in
the hypodermis and muscles,
the histolysis of the larval digestive
tract and its new formation
from separate imaginal buds go
on simultaneously, so that the
continuity of the process is not
interrupted.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id089'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The imaginal buds of the
much-shortened pupal digestive
canal occur in the mid-intestine
(stomach) in the form of numerous
scattered groups of cells
(Fig. 633, <i>ie</i>), and in the fore-
and hind-intestine in the form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>of rings (<i>v</i> and <i>h</i>) of imaginal tissue. The imaginal ring of the
fore-intestine (<i>v</i>) lies in the region of the proventriculus (<i>pr</i>, compare
Fig. 635, <i>im</i>), while that of the hind-intestine is situated
directly behind the base of the urinary tubes. The regeneration
of these two parts of the digestive canal is not entirely accomplished
by these two rings, but the imaginal rudiments of the neighboring
parts of the outer surface of the body also have a share in it. Thus
it appears that the foremost part of the œsophagus is built up from the
imaginal buds in the region of the mouth, while the imaginal buds surrounding
the anus in the 8th abdominal segment (Fig. 633.
<i>ims</i>) produce by invagination the rectal pouches, together with the
rectal papillæ.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The formation of the mid-intestine (stomach) takes place in such
a way that the island-like imaginal buds spread out by cell-multiplication
over the outer or basal surface of the larval mid-intestinal
epithelium (Fig. 634, <i>o</i>), until they finally unite, so as to form the
wall of the imaginal mid-intestine (stomach). At the same time
the entire larval epithelium (<i>e</i>) is cast in the interior and forms the
so-called yellow body, which becomes surrounded by a layer of small
cells and a jelly-like mass, and remains until its destruction in the
pupal stomach. The larval muscular layer (<i>m</i>) remains intact as
long as the imaginal mid-intestine is not fully developed, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>it is attacked and destroyed by phagocytes. The final muscular
layer arises from single cells lying on the outer surface of the
imaginal buds (Figs. 633, <i>im</i>, 634, <i>m′</i>), which should be regarded as
special imaginal cells of the mid-intestinal muscular layer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transformation of the fore-intestine is introduced by a degeneration
of the proventriculus and sucking stomach. The proventriculus
(Fig. 635, <i>pr</i>), which had been formed from a circular fold
of the fore-intestine, disappears by the smoothing out of this folded
structure. The sucking stomach also similarly degenerates by withdrawing
gradually into the œsophagus, so that instead of the original
diverticulum there remains only an enlargement of the œsophageal
cavity. At the same time this part of the canal is attacked and
destroyed by phagocytes, while the destroyed portions become replaced
by the gradually extending imaginal parts of the wall. The
imaginal ring of the fore-intestine (Fig. 635, <i>im</i>), which, according
to Kowalevsky, is concerned in the formation of a great part of the
definitive œsophagus, becomes closed at its hinder end so that the
communication with the mid-intestine appears to be interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hind-intestine of the imago is rebuilt in exactly the same
manner. Here also the imaginal ring widens and forms a tube,
which while it grows around the openings into the urinary tubes,
closes itself against the mid-intestine, while behind it remains in
connection with the larval hind-intestine. In a similar way the
larval hind-intestine is attacked by the growth from behind of an
imaginal ring, which proceeds from imaginal buds near the anus,
until finally, when the entire larval hind-intestine is reduced to
granule-balls, the two imaginal sections of the tube are brought into
contact with each other. (Kowalevsky in Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'>The larval salivary glands (Fig. 633, <i>sp</i>) are completely destroyed by
phagocytes. Then succeeds the new formation of these glands from imaginal
buds, which, according to Kowalevsky, form rings situated at their anterior ends.</p>

<p class='c013'>The nature of the transformation undergone by the urinary tubes is not yet
well ascertained. According to Van Rees, there is in this case perhaps a regeneration
of the larval cells by division, but on the other side there may be a
histolysis of these elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above-described method of transformation of the digestive canal seems,
according to Korschelt and Heider, to be very common among the holometabolic
insects. It has not only been observed in the Diptera, but also in the
Lepidoptera (Kowalevsky, Frenzel), Coleoptera (Ganin), and Hymenoptera
(Ganin). The stripping off of the epithelium of the mid-intestine was found
by Kowalevsky to occur also in Corethra, Culex, and Chironomus.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The tracheal system.</b>—As we have seen (p. 448), the tracheal system
of caterpillars just before pupation undergoes disintegration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>accompanied by a reformation of the peritoneal membrane and
tænidia. The larval ectotrachea undergoes histolysis, that of the
imago being meanwhile formed; the larval tænidia also break up,
dissolve, and are replaced by new tænidia which arise from the
nuclei of the peritoneal membrane. That the tracheal system in
the Muscidæ during metamorphosis undergoes a transformation is
shown, as Korschelt and Heider claim, by the entirely different
shape of the system in the maggot, the pupa, and the fly. The air
is admitted to the tracheal system of the maggot, not by lateral
openings, but through the two stigmata at the end of the body.
On the other hand, the pupa breathes by prothoracic spiracles, while
the fly has six pairs of lateral stigmata of the normal structure.
There may be in the larva and pupa vestigial closed stigmata,
as there are in the thorax of caterpillars, with tracheal branches
leading to where were once functional stigmata. These stigmatal
branches, as well as some other portions of the tracheal system
already observed by Weismann, seem, according to Van Rees, to
function as imaginal buds for the regeneration of the tracheal
matrix, while frequently also a regeneration of this epithelium, by a
simple repeated division of cells, may be recognized. The disintegration
of the tracheal system is accomplished by means of phagocytes
in the manner already described.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The nervous system.</b>—The central nervous system passes directly
from the larval into the imaginal stage, since it must continue to
exercise most of its functions throughout metamorphosis, though
it undergoes important changes of form and position. At the same
time, certain histological transformations occur which may be regarded
as a histolysis. Such is the destruction and rebuilding in
the interior of the organs, which, however, preserve their continuity.
Every case of destruction of tissues in the pupa has come to be
regarded as a histolysis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The problem of the transformation of the peripheral nervous system
is not yet well understood. Although during the destruction of
the larval muscles the motor nerves also in part degenerate, in the
case of the nerves distributed to the appendages the conditions are
different, as these may be recognized in the larva in the form of
the nerve-threads which place the imaginal buds in connection with
the central nervous system. These threads, according to Van Rees,
pass from the larva into the pupa and imago, so that with the farther
development of the rudiments of the extremities, only the distal
part of the nerves belonging to them are to be regarded as new
formations. (Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span><b>The fat-body.</b>—The larval fat-body is also destroyed through the
activity of the leucocytes in the same way as the other tissues.
The reformation of the fat-body seems to begin in the mesoderm
of the imaginal buds. Possibly, also, the masses or collections of
embryonic cells which are regarded by Schaeffer as “blood-forming
cells,” may serve to regenerate the fat-body. At all events,
they have been derived from the mesodermal tissues. Though
Wielowiejsky saw the fat-body of Corethra arising from a cell-layer
situated under the hypodermis, yet it is not necessary to regard
this observation as favorable to the view of Schaeffer that in Musca
the larval fat-body is derived in part from the hypodermis, and in
part from the tracheal matrix, thus from the ectodermal tissues.
(Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Definitive fate of the leucocytes.</b>—We have seen that the formation
of the organs of the imago originates in the imaginal buds, in all
cases where these do not pass directly from the larva into the pupa.
The leucocytes, whose numbers in the pupa are greatly increased,
take no direct part in the formation of the tissues. Their importance
seems to lie in this, that they destroy those larval organs
doomed to destruction, the parts of which they take in and digest,
and possibly, by their powers of locomotion, convey particles of food
to the developing organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>What, on the other hand, is the fate of the leucocytes after the
developmental processes in the pupa have ceased? There can be no
doubt that a part of the so-called granule-cells are again transformed
into normal blood-corpuscles. Another, and, as it seems, more considerable,
share suffer degeneration. Finally, the leucocytes themselves
serve as nourishment for the newly formed tissues. Of
interest in this direction is the observation of Van Rees, that
numerous leucocytes finally pass into the newly-formed hypodermis
and then degenerate in crevices between the hypodermis-cells.
(Korschelt and Heider.)</p>

<p class='c013'>It has been suggested by Van Rees that the phagocytes attack all the larval
organs indiscriminately, but that the active metabolism of the imaginal buds
preserves them from these attacks. He also thinks that Kowalevsky is probably
right in supposing that the buds render themselves immune by some poisonous
secretion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pratt, however, thinks that the supposition of a protecting or poisonous
secretion is scarcely necessary to account for the phenomenon, and suggests that
the larval tissues are a prey to the phagocytes, because at the end of larval life
they become functionless and inactive, so as to become an easy prey to phagocytes
or disintegrating influences of any sort. On the other hand, the imaginal
buds “in which there is an exceedingly active metabolism, and <i>all the larval
<span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>organs which remain functional during the metamorphosis</i> are immune from the
attacks of the phagocytes. The heart in the muscids continues to beat, as
Künckel d’Herculais has observed, during the entire period of the metamorphosis,
with the exception of a day or two in the latter half of it. The nervous
system must continue functional during the entire time. The three pairs of
thoracic muscles which pass intact from the larva to the imago are probably
employed in respiration during the metamorphosis. The reproductive glands
are, like the imaginal disks, rapidly growing organs.” He adds that among the
other holometabolic insects many or most of the larval organs remain functional
during metamorphosis, hence there is but little histolysis. “But the larval
intestine would always necessarily become unfunctional, and, as we have seen,
Kowalevsky is of the opinion that the larval mid-gut in all holometabolic insects
contains imaginal disks, and undergoes degeneration during the metamorphosis.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The post-embryonic changes and imaginal buds in the Pupipara
(Melophagus).</b>—The sheep-tick (Melophagus) is still more modified
than the Muscidæ; the larva is apodous and acephalous, but, as
Pratt observes, much less highly specialized than those of muscids,
and in respect to the position of the thoracic buds it closely resembles
Corethra. They lie just beneath the hypodermis in
two very regular rows, and not in the centre of the body, as in
Musca (Figs. 628, 636, <i>C</i>). While, however, in Corethra all the thoracic
buds are of larval origin, arising after the last larval moult, in
Melophagus, on the other hand, each of these buds, except the
dorsal prothoracic, arises in the embryo, as is also the case in Musca.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cephalic buds the conditions are similar to those in Musca,
but still more complicated. Instead of a single pair of head-buds,
there are two pairs, one dorsal and one ventral. “The dorsal pair
corresponds to the muscidian head-disks in every respect; they are
destined to form the dorsal and lateral portions of the imaginal
head, together with the compound eyes. The ventral head-disks
have no counterpart in Musca. The fate of these disks or buds is to
form the ventral portion of the head, the paired projections forming
the rudiments of the proboscis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The formation of the head-vesicle proceeds in a way similar to
that in Musca. The ventral disk fuses early at its lateral edges with
the dorsal pair. The communications between both ventral and
dorsal disks and the pharynx rapidly widen (in the old larva they
have already become very large), and soon the disks and pharynx
form together a single vesicle, which is the head-vesicle.” The
imaginal buds of the abdomen Pratt finds to be exactly as in the
corresponding ones of Musca.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the embryo of Melophagus the cephalic and thoracic imaginal
buds first appear as local thickenings, followed by the invagination
of the ectoderm; the cephalic buds first appear very early in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>ontogeny of the insect (Fig. 636, <i>C</i>), just as the germs of the digestive
canal, nervous system, and tracheæ are appearing. The single
median thickening (<i>v</i>) is destined to form the ventral cephalic bud,
while the pair of thickenings behind (<i>d</i>) become the dorsal buds,
those homologous with the cephalic buds of Musca.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The thoracic buds, which arise as hypodermic thickenings, do not
appear until late in embryonic life, until the time of the involution
of the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pratt did not observe in the embryo the buds of the internal
organs and of the abdominal hypodermis, and thinks it probable
that they appear first in the larva.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><i>c.</i> General summary</h4>

<p class='c016'>We have seen that in Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and
Hymenoptera, and with little doubt in all the holometabolous insects,
the parts of the imago originate in single formative cellular masses
(imaginal buds) already present in the larva, and often even in the
later embryonic stages. There are such imaginal buds for each part
of the body,—for the appendages of the head, for the legs and wings,
for the ovipositor, and probably for the cercopods, for the hypodermis
of the abdomen, and for the different sections of the digestive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>canal. We have seen, as Korschelt and Heider state, that the
formation of the mesodermal organs of the imago (muscles, connective
tissue, fat-body) begins in the mesodermal part of the
imaginal buds, whose first origin is still obscure. Simultaneously
with the formation of the imaginal organs, there goes on under the
influence of the leucocytes the destruction of the larval organs.
Both processes (destruction and regeneration) therefore go on hand
in hand, so that the continuity of the organs in question in most
cases remains perfect, inasmuch as the complete destruction only
ensues after the formation of the final organs. The only exceptions
are most of the muscles of the larva, which are destroyed at a very
early period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, it is evident that the sharp division into larval, pupal,
and imaginal stages only applies to the external surface of the
body, since they follow one another after successive moults. The
processes of the internal development, on the other hand, form an
entirely continuous series of transformations between which is no
sharp line of demarcation. Yet as a whole the form of the larva,
pupa, and imago are kept distinct in adaptation to their separate
environments and habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, as Pratt very truly remarks, the epigenetic period in
insects, when new organs are forming, does not end with the birth
of the larva from the egg, but extends through the larval, and even
through the pupal period. “The principal significance of the pupal
period and the metamorphosis is that it is the time when the larval
characters which were adapted for use during a period of free life in
the midst of the development, and which would be valueless to the
imago, are corrected or abandoned.”</p>

<h3 class='c002'>HYPERMETAMORPHISM</h3>
<p class='c006'>When an insect passes through more than the three normal stages
of metamorphosis, <i>i.e.</i> the larval, pupal, and imaginal, it is said to
undergo a <i>hypermetamorphosis</i>. The best-known examples are the
supernumerary stages of Meloë, Stylops, etc.</p>

is an active Campodea-like larva,
which runs about and climbs up
flowers, from which it creeps upon
the bodies of bees, such as Anthophora
and Andrena, who carry it to
their cells, wherein their eggs are
situated. The triungulin feeds
upon and destroys the eggs of its
hostess. Meanwhile its inactive life
in the bee’s cell reacts upon the
organism; after moulting, the-second larval form (Fig. 640, <i>b</i>) is
attained, and now the body is thick, cylindrical, soft, and fleshy, and
it resembles a lamellicorn larva, with three pairs of rather long thoracic
legs. This is Riley’s carabidoid stage. This second larva feeds
upon the honey stored up for the young or larval bees. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>another moult, there is another entire change in the body; it is
motionless, the head is mask-like without movable appendages, and
the feet are represented by six tubercles. This is called the semipupa
or pseudo-pupal stage. This form moults, and changes to a
third larval form (<i>c</i>), when apparently, as the result of its rich,
concentrated food, it is overgrown, thick-bodied, without legs, and
resembles a larval bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>After thus passing through three larval stages, each remarkably
different in structure
and in the manner of
taking food, it transforms
into a pupa of
the ordinary coleopterous
shape (<i>d</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of Sitaris,
as worked out by
Fabre and more recently
by Valery-Mayet,
is a similar
story of two strikingly
different adaptational
larval forms succeeding
the triungulin or primitive larval stage. The first larva (Fig.
641, <i>a</i>) is in general like that of Meloë, the second (<i>b</i>) is thick, oval,
fleshy, soft-bodied, and with minute legs, evidently of no use, the
larva feeding on the honey stored by its host. The pseudo-pupal
stage is still more maggot-like than in the corresponding stage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>Meloë, and the third larva (<i>f</i>) is thick-bodied, with short thoracic
legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the complicated life-history of another cantharid, <i>Epicauta vittata</i>,
as worked out by Riley (Fig. 642), we have the same acquisition
of new habits and forms after the first larval stage, which evidently
were at the outset the result of an adaptation to a change of
food and surroundings. The female Epicauta lays its eggs in the
same warm, sunny situation as that chosen by locusts (Caloptenus)
for depositing their eggs. On hatching, the active minute carnivorous
triungulin, ever on the search for eggs, on happening upon a
locust egg gnaws into it, and then sucks the contents. A second
egg is attacked and its contents exhausted, when, owing to its comparatively
inactive habits and rich nourishing food after a period of
inactivity and rest, the skin splits along its back, and at about the
eighth day from beginning to take food the second larva appears,
with much smaller and shorter legs, a much smaller head, and with
reduced mouth-parts. This is the carabidoid stage of Riley. After
feeding for about a week in the egg a second moult occurs, and the
change of form is slight, though the mouth-parts and legs are still
more rudimentary, and the body assumes “the clumsy aspect of the
typical lamellicorn larva.” This Riley denominates the scarabæidoid
stage of the second larva.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After six or seven days there is another transformation, the skin
being cast, and the insect passes into another stage, “the ultimate
stage of the second larva.” The larva, immersed in its rich nutritious
food, grows rapidly, and after about a week leaves the now
addled and decaying locust eggs, and burrows into the clear sand,
where it lies on its side in a smooth cell or cavity, and where it
undergoes an incomplete ecdysis, the skin not being completely
shed, and assumes the semipupa stage, or coarctate larval stage of
Riley.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the spring the partly loose skin is rent on the top of the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>and thorax, and then crawls out of it the “third larva,” which only
differs from the ultimate stage of the second larva “in the somewhat
reduced size and greater whiteness.” The insect in this stage is said
to be rather active, and burrows about in the ground, but food is not
essential, and in a few days it transforms into the true pupa state.</p>

<p class='c007'>These habits and the corresponding hypermetamorphosis are probably
common to all the Meloidæ, though the life-history of the other
species has yet to be traced.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the genus Hornia described by Riley, the wings of the imago
are more reduced than in any other of the family, both sexes having
the elytra as rudimentary as in the European female glow-worm
(<i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>). These, with the simple tarsal claws and the
enlarged heavy abdomen, as Riley remarks, “show it to be a degradational
form.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Its host is Anthophora, and the beetle itself lives permanently in
the sealed cells of the bee, and Riley thinks it is subterranean, seldom
if ever leaving the bee gallery. The triungulin is unknown, but
the ultimate stage of the second larva, as well as the coarctate larva,
is like those of the family in general, the final transformations taking
place within the two unrent skins, in this respect the insect (Fig. 643)
approaching Sitaris.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears, then, that as the result of its semi-parasitic mode of life
the Campodea-form or triungulin larva of these insects, which has
free-biting mouth-parts like the larvæ of Carabidæ and other carnivorous
beetles, instead of continuing to lead an active life and feeding
on other insects; living or dead, and then like other beetles directly
transforming into the normal pupa, moults as many as five times,
there being six distinct stages before the true pupa stage is entered
upon. So that there are in all eight stages including the imaginal
or last stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>One cannot avoid drawing the very obvious conclusion that the
five extra stages constituting this hypermetamorphosis, as it is so
well styled, are structural episodes, so to speak, due to the peculiar
parasitic mode of life, and were evidently in adaptation to the remarkable
changes of environment, so unlike those to which the
members of other families of Coleoptera, the Stylopidæ excepted,
have been subjected. The fat overgrown body and the atrophied
limbs and mouth-parts are with little doubt due to the abundant
supply of rich food, the protoplasm of the egg of its host, in which
the insect during the feeding time of its life is immersed. Since it
is well known that parthenogenesis is due to over, or at least to
abundant nutrition, or to a generous diet and favoring temperature,
there is little reason to doubt that the greatly altered and abnormally
fat or bloated body of the insect in these supernumerary stages is
the result of a continuous supply of rich pabulum, which the insect
can imbibe with little or no effort.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 644.</span>—Triungulin stage of <i>Stylops childreni</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The life-history of the Stylopidæ is after the same general fashion,
though we do not as yet know many of the most important details.
The females are viviparous, the young
hatching within the body of the parent, as
we once found as many as 300 of the very
minute triungulin larvæ issuing in every
direction from the body of what we have
regarded as the female of <i>Stylops childreni</i>
in a stylopized Andrena caught in the last
of April. The larvæ differ notably from
those of the Meloidæ in the feet being bulbous
and without claws, yet it is in general
Campodea-like and in essential features a
triungulin (Fig. 644). The intestine ends
in a blind sac, as in the larvæ of bees,
and this would indicate that its food is honey. The complete
life-history of no Stylopid is completely known. It is probable
that, hatched in June from eggs fertilized in April, the larvæ crawl
upon the bodies of bees and wasps; finally, after a series of larval
stages as yet unknown,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a> penetrating within the abdomen of its host
before the latter hibernates, and living there through the winter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_696'>696</span>The females, owing to their parasitic life, retain the larval form,
while the free males are winged, not leading in the adult stage a
parasitic life, though passing their larval and pupal stages in the
body of their host, and are so unlike ordinary beetles as to be
referred by good authorities to a distinct order (Strepsiptera).</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic007'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 645.</span>—<i>Stylops childreni</i>, ♂: <i>a</i>, abdomen of Andrena with ♀ Stylops (<i>b</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The triungulin stage of these insects corresponds in general to the
form of the larval Staphylinidæ and allied families, such as the
Tenebrionidæ, which are active in their habits, running about and
obtaining their food in a haphazard way, often necessarily suffering
long fasts. In the external-feeding, less active coleopterous larvæ,
like the phytophagous species, which have an uninterrupted supply
of nutritious food, we see that the body is thick and fleshy. So also
in the larvæ of the Scarabæidæ, Ptinidæ, and the wood-boring groups.
In internal feeders, like the larval weevils and Scolytidæ, which live
nearly motionless in seeds, fruits, and the sap-wood of plants and
trees, with a constant supply of nourishing, often rich food, the eruciform
body is soft, thick, and more or less oval-cylindrical. So it is
with the larvæ of Hymenoptera, especially in the parasitic forms,
and in the ants, wasps, and bees, which are nearly if not quite
motionless, at least not walking about after their food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the change from the active triungulin stage to the series of
secondary, nearly legless, sedentary, inactive stages is plainly enough
due to the change of station and to the change of food. From being
an independent, active, roving triungulin, the young insect becomes
a lodger or boarder, fed at the expense of its host, and the lack of
bodily exertion, coupled with the presence of more liquid food than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>is actually needed for its bare existence, at once induces rotundity
of body and a loss of power in the limbs, followed by their partial
or total atrophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>That this process of degeneration may even occur in one and the
same stage of larval existence is very well illustrated by what we
know of the life-history of the wasp-parasite of Europe, <i>Rhipiphorus
paradoxus</i>. Thanks to the very careful and patient observations of
Dr. T. A. Chapman, we have a nearly complete life-history of this
beetle, the representative of a family in many respects connecting
the Meloidæ and Stylopidæ.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Where Rhipiphorus lays her eggs is
unknown. Dr. Chapman, however, found a solitary specimen of the
young larva in the triungulin stage. He describes it as “a little
black hexapod, about <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>50</span></span> inch (.5 mm.) in length, and <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>120</span></span> inch in
breadth, broadest about the fourth segment, and tapering to a point
at the tail; a triangular head with a pair of three-jointed antennæ
nearly as long as the width of the head, with legs very like those of
Meloë larvæ; the tibiæ ending in two or three claws, which are supported
and even obscured by a large transparent pulvillus or sucker
of about twice their length; this was marked by faint striæ radiating
from the extremity of the tibiæ, giving it much the aspect of a
lobe of a fly’s proboscis. Each abdominal segment had a very short
lateral spine pointing backwards; the last segment terminated by a
large double sucker similar to those of the legs; and the little animal
frequently stood up on this, and pawed the air with its feet, as if in
search of some fresh object to lay hold of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This almost microscopic larva finds a wasp grub and bores into its
body, probably entering at a point near the back of the first or second
segment behind the head. Dr. Chapman succeeded in finding the
larva of the beetle within that of the wasp, before the latter had
spun up. “Assuming that the wasp larva lives six days in its last
skin before spinning up, I should guess that the youngest of these
had still two or three days’ feeding to do. The Rhipiphorus larvæ
were but a little way beneath the skin of the back, about the fourth
and fifth segments [counting the head as the first], and indifferently
on either side. The smallest of these was <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>16</span></span> inch in length, and,
except its smaller size, was precisely like the larger ones I am about
to refer to, having the same head, legs, plates, etc. These were of
the same size as those of the larger larvæ, the difference in size
of the latter being due to the expansion of the intermediate colorless
integument.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>After the wasp grub has spun the silken covering of its cell the
larva of Rhipiphorus may still be detected in some of them, being
rendered visible by its black legs and dark dorsal and ventral plates.
“On extracting this larva, it bears a general resemblance in size and
outline to the youngest larva of Rhipiphorus that I had found feeding
externally on the wasp grub, but with the very notable exception of
the already mentioned black marks. These are, in fact, a corneous
head, six-jointed legs, and a dorsal and ventral series of plates. I
immediately recognized the head and legs as identical with those of
the little black mite already described, but presenting a ludicrous
appearance in being widely separated from each other by the white
skin of the larva. I have no doubt that the dorsal and ventral series
of black marks are the corresponding plates of the mite-like larva
floated away from each other by the expansion of the intervening
membrane. By measurement also they agree exactly in size, although
the larva extracted from the wasp grub is ten times the length and
six times the width of the little Meloë-like larva. In length it is
⅙ inch (4.5 mm.), and <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>28</span></span> inch in breadth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The remarkable changes thus described in the larva of this beetle
after it has begun its parasitic life within the body of its host are
especially noteworthy because the great increase in size and difference
in shape, as well as in habits, all take place before the insect
has moulted. The rapid development in size, and consequent distension
of the body and the separation of the sclerites of the segments
behind the head, are paralleled, as Chapman says, by the greatly
swollen abdominal region of the body in <i>Sarcopsylla penetrans</i> and in
the female of the Termitidæ. In those insects this distension is due
to the enlargement of the ovaries and of the eggs contained within
them, but in the Rhipiphorus it is due to the comparative inactivity
of the larva, and to its being gorged with an unending supply of
rich food, the blood and fat of its host. It follows, then, that if a
sedentary life and over, or at least abundant, nutrition will have
this effect within the short period covered by the single first larval
stage of the Rhipiphorus, it is reasonable to infer that the hypermetamorphosis
is also due to the same factors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chapman then goes on to say that finally, within six hours of the
time of spinning up of the wasp grub, the Rhipiphorus larva at the
end of Stage 1., which is “usually in motion, and for its situation
might be called tolerably active, is seen to lay hold of the interior of
the skin with its anterior legs, and keeps biting and scratching with
its strong and sharp jaws until it is able to thrust through its head,
when, in less than a quarter of an hour, it completely emerges by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span>vermiform movement; and at the same time it casts a skin, together
with the black head, legs, plates, etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The larva, now in its second stage, passes forward and seizes hold
of the upper or lateral aspect of the prothoracic segment of the wasp
grub. On emerging it becomes shorter and thicker, “and very soon
loses length by that curving forward of its head which is so marked
in the full-grown larva, and which does not exist before its emergence.”
The larva is now found “lying like a collar immediately
under the head of the wasp grub, and is attached to it by the head,
though not very firmly.” At this stage the feeding of the young
Rhipiphorus is rather sucking than eating.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When about 6 mm. in length it moults a second time, and the full-grown
larva closely though superficially resembles a Crabro or Pemphredon
larva, the small head being bent over forwards. By the
time it is ready to pupate it has wholly eaten the wasp larva, and
the temperature of the cell being high, a larva 5 mm. long grows
large enough in two days to fill the top of the cell of its host, and
the larva is ready to pupate about a week after hatching, so that its
development is very rapid. The beetles themselves do not live in
the cells. Chapman thinks they hibernate, and that the eggs are
laid in the spring or summer.</p>

<p class='c007'>We thus have in this insect three larval stages, the triungulin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>two later stages, the great differences between the first and the last
two being apparently due to their parasitic mode of life, the larva
spending its second stage within its host, involving an existence in a
cell with a high temperature, an uninterrupted supply of rich, stimulating
food, and a comparatively sedentary mode of life compared
with that of the triungulin at the beginning of its existence. It is
quite obvious that the hypermetamorphosis is primarily due to a
great change in its surroundings, <i>i.e.</i> the parasitic mode of life of
the beetle, habits of very rare occurrence in the Coleoptera, numerous
in species as they are.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection attention may be drawn to a supernumerary
larval stage observed by Riley in the pea- and bean-weevils (Figs.
646 and 647). The larva on hatching has long slender legs, though
differing from those of an ordinary coleopterous larva in having but
three joints (<i>j</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>). This stage is very short, and the legs temporary,
as, after entering the bean or pea, it casts its skin, losing its
legs, and assuming the vermiform shape of the second larval stage.
In this case the change from a pedate to an apodous larva is plainly
enough due to the change from an external feeder, like a chrysomelid
larva, to a larva leading a boring, internal, almost quiescent life.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>Certain ichneumons also appear to have two distinct larval stages,

<p class='c007'>In a species of Platygaster which is
parasitic in the larva of Cecidomia, the
first larva (Cyclops stage) is of a remarkable
shape, not like an insect, but
rudely resembling a parasitic Copepod
crustacean. In this condition it clings
to the inside of its host by means of
its hook-like jaws, moving about, as
Ganin says, like a Cestodes embryo
with its well-known six hooks. In
this stage it has no nervous, vascular,
or respiratory system, and the digestive
canal is a blind one (Fig. 651).</p>

<p class='c007'>After moulting, the insect entirely

canal and a nervous and vascular system (Fig. 652).</p>

<p class='c007'>After a second moult the third and last larval stage is attained,
and the insect is of the ordinary appearance of ichneumon larvæ.</p>

eggs in those of a small dragon-fly (<i>Agrion virgo</i>). The first larval

being merely a flask-shaped sac of cells. After remaining in

<p class='c007'>The second stage, or Histriobdella-like form, as Ganin names it,
is more like that leech-like worm than an insect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third larval form is very bizarre, though more as in insects, having
rudimentary antennæ, mouth-parts, legs, and ovipositor. In this
condition it lives from six to seven days before pupating (Fig. 653).</p>

<p class='c007'>The strange history of another egg-parasite (Ophioneurus) agrees
in some respects with that of the foregoing forms. It is when
hatched of an oval shape, with scarcely any organs, and differs from
the genera already mentioned in remaining within its egg-membrane,
and not assuming their strange shapes. From the cylindrical sac-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>non-segmented larva resembling the second larva of Platygaster
it passes directly into the pupa state.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fourth form, Teleas (Fig. 654, <i>A-D</i>), is an egg-parasite of Gerris,
and in America one species oviposits in the eggs of Œcanthus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spindle-shaped larva in its first stage roughly resembles a
trochosphere of a worm rather than the larva of an insect so high in
the scale as a Hymenopter. It is active, but after moulting the
second larva is oval, still without segments. Dr. Ayers gives a profusion
of details and figures of the
first and second stages of our Teleas,
the second strongly resembling the
Cyclops stage of Ganin. He describes
three stages, and though he
did not complete the life-history of
the insect, he thinks it changes to an ovoid flattened form which
succeeds the Cyclops stage in other Pteromalidæ, and that there
are at least four ecdyses.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to account for these strange larval forms, unless we
suppose that the embryos, by their rich, abundant food, have undergone
a premature development, the growth of the body-walls being
greatly accelerated, the insects so to speak having been, under the
stimulus of over-nutrition and their unusual environment, and perhaps
also the high temperature of the egg, hurried into vermian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>existence on a plane scarcely higher than that of an active ciliated
gastrula.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further observations, difficult though they will be, are needed to
enable us to account for the singular prematurity of the embryo of
these parasites. That these stages are reversional and a direct inheritance
from the vermian ancestors of these insects is not probable,
but the forms are evidently the result of adaptation in response
to a series of stimuli whose nature is in part appreciable but mostly
unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be noted, however, that the appearance of a primitive band
in the second larval stage suggests the origin of these forms, as well
as that of insects in general, from a Peripatus-like, and again from
an earlier leech-like Annelid ancestor. Hence the first larval or
Cyclops stage is due to a precocious development caused by the
unusual environment, and is simply adaptational, and not of phylogenetic
significance.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>SUMMARY OF THE FACTS AND SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE CAUSES OF METAMORPHISM</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>An explanation of the causes of metamorphosis is one of the
most difficult undertakings in biology, and the phenomenon has
been considered as one of the chief difficulties in the way of the
acceptance of the theory of descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>A review, however, of the facts of hypermetamorphism, particularly
the life-history of Mantispa, throws much light on the subject,
since it is very probable that the supernumerary stages and marked
changes of form characterizing them are due to changes of environment,
of habits, and of food, causes which have exerted such a profound
influence on organic beings throughout all time. Besides
these, as the result of changes in the environment and nature of the
food, we have the results brought about by the use or disuse of
structures brought into existence by the action of stimuli from without,
the class of insects abounding in examples of temporary structures
which perform a certain function, and then disappear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, if the origin of a hypermetamorphosis can thus be explained,
it follows that normal metamorphosis is most probably due
to changes of habitat, of seasons, of food, and to accelerated growth
resulting from the approach of sexual maturity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following facts and conclusions appear to be well established:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The apterous insects (Synaptera) are ametabolous, only the
winged insects undergoing a metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The complete metamorphosis was not inherited from the primitive
ancestor of all insects, but acquired at a later period (F. Müller).
The eruciform type is a secondary, adaptive form, derived from the
earlier, campodeoid type of larva.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The earliest, most primitive pterygote insects passed through
only a slight metamorphosis. In other words, as soon as the wings
were evolved and insects became adapted to live or take refuge in a
new medium, the air, at the approach of the period of adult life,
with the ripening or perfection of the reproductive organs, a metamorphosis
began to take place, and the number of species greatly
multiplied. On the other hand, the Arachnida and Myriopoda, in
which as a rule there is no metamorphosis, being confined to a creeping
life, with no change of medium, remained poor in number of
species.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. At first the nymphs mainly differed from the adults in lacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>wings, though having the same habits; in holometabolous insects,
the larva became adapted to entirely different habits and environments,
so that in Hymenoptera, and especially Diptera, the larva
became remarkably unlike the imago.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Until the Mesozoic age, or late in the Carboniferous period,
there were, so far as we now know, only ametabolous and heterometabolous
insects, and these orders (Orthoptera, Dermaptera, Hemiptera,
Plectoptera, Odonata, and Neuroptera) were not numerically rich in
genera and species, while since early Mesozoic times geological extinction
has reduced their numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. During the Mesozoic age, and since then, the number of species,
genera, families, and orders has greatly increased, and insects have become
more and more holometabolous. The orders of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera,
Hymenoptera, and Diptera are many fold greater in number
of species and variety of form than the heterometabolous orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rapid increase in the number and variety of types of insects
evidently is correlated with the profound geological changes which
took place at the end of the Paleozoic age, involving the appearance
of larger continental masses, or a greater land area, thus opening new
regions for settlement. Also the origin of flowering plants at about
this time undoubtedly had much to do with the genesis of new
adaptive structures, such as the changes in the mouth-parts and
wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. The process of metamorphosis, at least in the subtropical, temperate,
and polar regions, is largely dependent on the change from
summer to winter, and, in the tropics, from the rainy to the dry
season.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the organization of larval (nepionic) as compared with
imaginal forms, the nymphs and larvæ of insects are, with the exception
of many Diptera, nearly as perfectly developed as the adult. In
this respect the immature insect differs fundamentally from the
larvæ of certain worms (for example, the pilidium of Nemerteans)
and from the pluteus and brachiolaria stages of echinoderms, which
possess only digestive and water-vascular organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Insect nymphs and larvæ also differ from the nauplius and zoëa of
Crustacea in having at birth all the most important systems of
organs (digestive, circulatory, respiratory, nervous, muscular, with
sometimes a nearly perfected reproductive system) of the imago,
also the same number of cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal segments
and appendages. Metamorphism in insects involves (except in the
Diptera) rather modifications in the form and functions of organs
and appendages already present than the formation of new ones. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>larval Crustacea, the thoracic and abdominal appendages do not arise
until some time after hatching from the egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. While cases of the suppression or abbreviation of larval characters
and direct development are not uncommon in echinoderms
and crustaceans, in insects this phenomenon occurs only so far as
yet known in the Diptera. In these insects the polypody in the
embryo is outgrown, or lost, the embryos and larvæ not having even
the temporary rudiments of abdominal appendages. The campodeoid
characters also are entirely suppressed, dropped, or lost in the
more specialized holometabolous orders, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera,
and Diptera, though retained in the more primitive and generalized
Coleoptera. (This proves that the Coleoptera are lower or more
primitive and generalized than the other orders mentioned.) This
abbreviation or loss of organs is, as Hyatt and Arms claim, due to
the prepotency of acquired characters in phylogeny, and are also the
result of homochronous heredity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Insecta of the more specialized orders, x.-xvi., afford, next to some parasites,
the most notable examples of this mode of evolution. Their larval or
nepionic, and pupal or neanic, stages are prolonged at the expense of the
ephebic, winged stage, and the reasons for this prolongation are found in the
great number of new features introduced into these stages of development in these
orders as contrasted with those of the more primitive, and, in large part, more
ancient orders, i.-ix. The law of tachygenesis has been at work here, as in the
former cases alluded to above, and it is shown in the encroachments of the
adaptive characteristics of the caterpillar, grub, and maggot upon the inherited
characteristics of the Thysanuran stage, which loses its ancestral characteristics,
until in most cases they are either obsolete or recognizable with difficulty.”
(Hyatt and Arms, Natural Science, 1896, p. 400.)</p>

<p class='c007'>9. In the holometabolous insects there is a resting, quiescent
stage during the pupal period, when the insect takes no food. In
this respect the more specialized insects differ from other metamorphic
animals. The larva has an abundant supply of fat lasting
through pupal life, while in the quiescent pupa, respiration and circulation
is much lessened, the animal being as a rule motionless.
This resting stage is also necessary for the histolysis and formation
of the adult body from the imaginal buds present in the larva.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. The hypermetamorphosis of Mantispa, Meloë, Stylops, etc.,
indicate very plainly that the eruciform type of larva is derived
from the campodeoid, since one and the same insect passes through
these stages before reaching sexual maturity.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. As observed by Miall, the larva of insects differs from that
of other invertebrate animals in being larger than the adult.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. The metamorphoses of insects are in some important respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>paralleled by those of the Amphibia. The case of pædogenesis of
Chironomus affords a parallel with that of the Siredon, or larva of
Amblystoma. Also the organs and appendages of the insects, such
as caterpillars, are present, just as the skeleton and other organs of
the tadpole are the homologues of those of the adult, although these
parts undergo a profound modification, and new structures are added.
(See the discussion of this point by Miall, and by Hyatt and Arms.)</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Theoretical conclusions; Causes of metamorphosis.</b>—It results from
a review of the known facts, together with reasonable inductions
from such facts, that so far from opposing the theory of descent, the
facts of metamorphosis, and particularly of hypermetamorphosis,
seem to afford solid foundation for the theory. While natural selection
was not the initiative cause, it plays a part as one of several
factors; but the fundamental causes are the same as those which
have controlled the origin of species and of the larger groups of
animals in general. Owing to the struggle for existence, due to
overcrowding, the early insects were forced to take to the air, acquiring
wings to enable them to avoid the attacks of creeping and running
insects. In the end the insects became, owing to this acquisition
of wings, and afterwards to the establishment of a complicated
metamorphosis, numerically the most successful type of life in existence,
the number of species, extinct and living, mounting into the
millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>All aquatic insects are evidently the descendants of terrestrial
forms, and the numberless contrivances and temporary larval organs,
particularly of dipterous larvæ, are evidently adaptations to the
needs of the insect during its aquatic life, and which are cast aside
when the creature passes to a different medium. The sudden or
tachygenic appearance of temporary structures, such as hatching
spines, various setæ, spines, respiratory organs, so characteristic of
dipterous larvæ, and of the protective colors and markings of caterpillars,
and which are discarded at pupation, or imagination, are
evidently due to the action of stimuli from without, to the primary
neolamarckian factors, the characters proper to each larval stadium,
and to the pupal and imaginal stadia,—characters probably acquired
during the lifetime of the individual,—becoming finally fixed by
homochronous heredity.</p>

other Arachnida being entirely different from that of the myriopods and insects.</p>

resembles the myriopods, especially Geophilus, in the primitive band at first
lying on the surface of the yolk, and in the absence of an amniotic cavity; also before
hatching the abdomen is pressed against the thorax, as in myriopods.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. “Scolopendrella has very remarkable antennæ; they may be compared each to
a series of glass cups strung upon a delicate hyaline and extensible rod of uniform
thickness throughout; so that, like the body of the creature, they shrink enormously
when the animal is irritated or thrown into alcohol, and they then possess scarcely
two-thirds the length they have in the fully extended condition, their cup-like joints
being drawn close together, one within the other. Peripatus, Japyx, many (if not
all) Homoptera, and the S. Asiatic relatives of our common Glomeris have all more

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. We may add, while correcting the proofs of this book, that the important summary,
by Uzel, of his work on the embryology of Campodea appears in the Zoologischer
Anzeiger for July 5, 1897. He observes that the premandibular segment in the
embryo is very distinct, and that the two projections arising from it persist in the
adult. “Campodea is now the first example where these appendages are present in
the sexually mature insect and function as constituents of the completed mouth
parts. I propose for these hitherto overlooked structures the name of intercalary
lobes.” They each form a slightly developed chitinous lobe covering a gap between
the base of the labium and the fused external lobe and palpus of the first maxillæ
(which are inclined near the labium) in place of the mandibles which have sunken
inward. Uzel also homologizes these appendages with two similar projections
(Höcker) observed in the embryo of Geophilus by Zograf to be situated in front
of the mandibles. Heymons has also detected this segment in the embryo of Lepisma.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. While these pages are still in type, we may add, in confirmation of this view, that
Uzel states, from his researches on the embryology of Campodea, that the maxillary
tergites of the embryo only slightly share in building up the tergal region (occiput)
of the head, but that they form the genæ of the maxillary segments. (Zool. Anzeiger,
July 5, 1897,  p. 235.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Miall and Denny in their work on the cockroach, in describing the labium, remark:
“The upper edge is applied to the occipital frame, but is neither continuous with that
structure nor articulated thereto. By stripping off the labium upwards it may be
seen that it is really continuous with the chitinous integument of the neck” (p. 95).
This is, we think, a mistaken view, as proved by the embryology of the Odonata and
of Nematus. Our statements on this subject were first published in part in 1871, and
more fully in the third Report, U. S. Ent. Commission, 1883, pp. 284, 285. We also
stated that all the gular region of the head probably represents the base of the primitive
second maxillæ.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. After we had arrived at this conclusion, and written the above lines, we received
the Zoologischer Anzeiger for March 29, 1897, in which Dr. N. Léon publishes the same
view, stating that each side of the submentum is the homologue of the cardo, and
each side of the mentum corresponds to the stipes of a single maxilla (p. 74).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. Miall and Denny were the first to homologize the paraglossæ with the galea and
lacinia, showing the complete resemblance of the second maxillæ to the first pair,
remarking that “the homology of the labium with the first pair of maxillæ is in no
other insects so distinct as in the Orthoptera.” We have also independently arrived
at a similar conclusion, but believe that the mentum corresponds to the first maxillary
cardo, and the palpifer to the first maxillary stipes, the sclerite of each
maxilla being fused to form the base of the labium, <i>i.e.</i> the unpaired mentum and
submentum.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. Uzel states that what is regarded as the ligula of Campodea is formed from the
sternite of the first maxillary segment; while the two parts regarded as paraglossæ
grow out from the sternite of the mandibular segment, and these three structures
together he regards as the hypopharynx. (Zool. Anzeiger, July 5, 1897, p. 234.)</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. Pancritius, who also adopted Müller’s views, lays much stress on the fact that in
larvæ of some orders the tracheæ do not enter the rudimentary wings until the end
of larval life, and hence the wings have not originated from tracheal gills, but were
originally “perhaps only protective covers for the body.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. Von Lendenfeld, however, points out the fact that Straus-Durckheim proved
that the wings of beetles are moved by a complicated system of numerous muscles.
“In the Lepidoptera I have never found less than six muscles to each wing, as also
in the Hymenoptera and Diptera.” “The motions of the wings of Libellulidæ are the
combined working of numerous muscles and cords, and of a great number of chitinous
pieces connected by joints.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. Heymons, however, denies that the so-called cerci in Odonata are such, and

appendages of Calvert), because they arise from the tenth abdominal segment.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. It has been suggested to us by A. A. Packard that the power possessed by insects
of transporting loads much heavier than themselves is easily accounted for, when we
consider that the muscles of the legs of an insect the size of a house-fly (¼ inch long),
and supporting a load 399 times its own weight, would be subjected to the same stress
(per square inch of cross-section) as they would be in a fly 100 inches long of precisely
similar shape, that carried only its own weight; from the mechanical law that,
while the weight of similar bodies varies as the cube of the corresponding dimensions,
the area of cross-section of any part (such as a section of the muscles of the leg)
varies only as the square of the corresponding dimensions. In short, the muscles of
a fly carrying this great proportional weight undergo no greater tension than would
be exerted by a colossal insect in walking.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. This has been shown to be the case by Michels, who states that each commissure
is formed of three parallel bundles of elementary nerve-fibres, which pass continuously from one end of the ventral or nervous cord to the other. “The commissures
take their origin neither out of a central punctsubstanz (or marksubstanz), nor
from the peripheral ganglion-cells of the several ganglia, but are mere continuations
of the longitudinal fibres which decrease posteriorly in thickness, and extend anteriorly
through the commissures, forming the œsophageal ring, to the brain.”</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. The following extract from Newton’s paper shows, however, that the infra or
subœsophageal ganglion, according to Faivre, has the power of coördinating the movements
of the body; still, it seems to us that the brain is primarily concerned in the
exercise of this power, as the nerves from the subœsophageal ganglion supply only
the mouth-parts. “The physiological experiments of Faivre in 1857 (Ann. des Sci.
Nat. tom. viii, p. 245), upon the brain of Dyticus in relation to locomotion, are of
very considerable interest, showing, as they appear to do, that the power of coördinating
the movements of the body is lodged in the infraœsophageal ganglion. And
such being the case, both the upper and lower pairs of ganglia ought to be regarded
as forming parts of the insect’s brain.”—Quart. Jour. Micr. Sc., 1879, p. 342.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. In 1870 I observed these sense-pits in the antennæ and also in the cercopoda of
the cockroach (<i>Periplaneta americana</i>). I counted about 90 pits on each cercus.
They are much larger and much more numerous than similar pits in the antennæ of
the same insect. I compared them to similar pits in the antennæ of
the carrion-beetles, and argued that they were organs rather of the smelling
than hearing. (Amer. Nat., iv., Dec. 1870.) Organs of smell in the flies
(Chrysopila) and in the palpi, both labial and
maxillary, of Perla were described in the
same journal (Fig. 270). Compare Vom
Rath’s account of the organs in the cercopods
of Acheta (Fig. 271); also the singular
organ discovered by him on the end of the palpus of butterflies, in which a number of
hair-like rods (<i>sh</i>) are seated on branches of a common nerve (<i>n</i>, Fig. 272).</p>

organs are necessarily ears, and thinks that all insects are deaf, with no special
organs of hearing, but that sounds are heard by their tactile organs, just as deaf-mutes
perceive at a distance the rumbling of a carriage. But he appears to overlook
the fact that many Crustacea, and all shrimps and crabs, as well as many molluscs,
have organs of hearing. The German anatomist Will believes that insects hear only
the stridulation of their own species. Lubbock thinks that bees and ants are not
deaf, but hear sounds so shrill as to be beyond our hearing.</p>

Crustaceans, and Myriopods, has no analogy with the gastric juice of vertebrates; it
rather resembles the pancreatic sugar of the higher animals. The acidity quite often
observed is only very accessory in character, and not the sign of a physiological
property. “Farther, I have found it in insects; Hoppe-Seyler has demonstrated in
the Crustacea, and I have proved in the spiders, that the ferment causing the digestion
of albuminoids is evidently quite different from the gastric pepsine of vertebrates;
the addition of very feeble quantities of chlorhydric acid, far from promoting
its action, retards or completely arrests it.” (Bull. Acad. roy. Belgique, 1877, p. 27.)</p>

for <i>grès</i>, I applied to Dr. L. O. Howard, U. S. Entomologist, who kindly answers
as follows: “I have consulted Mr. Philip Walker, a silk expert, who writes me
the following paragraph: ‘<i>Grès</i>, as I understand it, is the gum of the silk fibre,
hence the French name for raw silk, <i>grèye</i>, which is in distinction to the silk that has
been boiled out in soap after twisting, or throwing, as it is called. As I understand
it, the silk fibre is composed of the <i>grès</i> and fibroin. The former is soluble in alkali,
like soap water, and the latter is not.’” While Blanc considers the <i>grès</i> as the
product of a special secretion of the wall of the reservoir, Gilson regards its production
as simultaneous with that of the silk or of the fibroin (<i>l.c.</i> 1893, p. 74).</p>

in a drop of dilute acetic acid, or in dilute sulphuric acid (10 per cent). In the first
case a cover-slip is placed on the fluid, and the crystals, which consist of oblique
rhombohedrons or derived forms, are usually at once apparent. If sulphuric acid is

not preëxist as germs, but are formed successively from the <i>rete mucosum</i>, which
itself is formed anew upon every change of skin, from what he denominates the <i>blood</i>,
or the chyle after it has passed through the pores of the intestinal canal into the

the nutritive functions of blood. He attributes these formations to a <i>vis formatrix</i>

to be stored up in the larva, that in the pupa state it may serve for the development of the imago. But he differs from them in asserting that in this state it is
destined to two distinct purposes: first, for the production of the muscles of the
butterfly, which he affirms are generated from it in the shape of slender bundles of
fibres; and, secondly, for the development and nutrition of the organs formed in the
larva, to effect which, he says, it is dissolved again into the mass of blood, and being
oxygenated by the air-vessels, becomes fit for nutrition, whence the epiploon appears
to be a kind of concrete chyle.” (Entwickelungsgeschichte der Schmetterlinge,
pp. 12–27.) It seems that Herold was right in deriving the pupa and imago from the
hypodermis (his <i>rete mucosum</i>), but wrong in denying that the germs did not preëxist
in the young caterpillar, and wrong in supposing that the latter originated from the
blood, also in supposing that the muscles owe their origin to the fat-body. Swammerdam,
and also Kirby and Spence, were correct in supposing that the imago arose
from “germs” in the larva, though wrong in adopting the “emboîtement” theory.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
