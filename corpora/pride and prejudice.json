    "23": "IT is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a\ngood fortune must be in want of a wife.\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the\nsurrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some\none or other of their daughters.\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you heard\nthat Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told\nme all about it.\u201d\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n\u201cDo not you want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife, impatiently.\n\u201cYou want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d ",
    "24": "This was invitation enough.\n\u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to\ntake possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in\nthe house by the end of next week.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\u201cBingley.\u201d\n\u201cIs he married or single?\u201d\n\u201cOh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d\n\u201cHow so? how can it affect them?\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome?\nYou must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d\n\u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d\n\u201cDesign? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\nmay fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon\nas he comes.\u201d\n\u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go\u2014or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as\nhandsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I\ndo not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\n\u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\n\u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes\ninto the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\n\u201cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, ",
    "25": "merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers.\nIndeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do\nnot.\u201d\n\u201cYou are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls\u2014though I\nmust throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\u201d\n\u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good\u0002humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.\u201d\n\u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he: \u201cthey\nare all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You\ntake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\u201d\n\u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these\ntwenty years at least.\u201d\n\u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d\n\u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\nvisit them.\u201d\n\u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.\u201d\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been\ninsufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less\ndifficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding, little\ninformation, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied\nherself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married:\nits solace was visiting and news. ",
    "26": "MR. BENNET was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\nBingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always\nassuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit\nwas paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\nsuddenly addressed her with,\u2014\n\u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother,\nresentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\n\u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of\nher.\u201d\n\u201cNo more have I,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; \u201cand I am glad to find that you do\nnot depend on her serving you.\u201d\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\u201cDon\u2019t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven\u2019s sake! Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\n\u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe times them\nill.\u201d\n\u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty, fretfully. \u201cWhen\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\n\u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\n\u201cAy, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come back till\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she\nwill not know him herself.\u201d",
    "27": "\u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to her.\u201d\n\u201cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with\nhim myself; how can you be so teasing?\u201d\n\u201cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\u2019s acquaintance is certainly\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.\nBut if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and\nher nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act\nof kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\u201d\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \u201cNonsense,\nnonsense!\u201d\n\u201cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\u201d cried he. \u201cDo\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them,\nas nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For\nyou are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books, and\nmake extracts.\u201d\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\u201cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201clet us return to Mr.\nBingley.\u201d\n\u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife.\n\u201cI am sorry to hear that; but why did you not tell me so before? If I had\nknown as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is\nvery unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the\nacquaintance now.\u201d\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished\u2014that of Mrs.\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was\nover, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\n\u201cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect\nsuch an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a good joke,\ntoo, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it\ntill now.\u201d\n\u201cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\u201d said Mr. Bennet;\nand, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",
    "28": "\u201cWhat an excellent father you have, girls,\u201d said she, when the door was\nshut. \u201cI do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Lydia, stoutly, \u201cI am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest.\u201d\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\nreturn Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to\ndinner.",
    "29": "NOT all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in\nvarious ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant\nsurmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to\naccept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\nreport was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He\nwas quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to\ncrown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.\nNothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step\ntowards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\u2019s heart were\nentertained.\n\u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\u201d said\nMrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the others equally well married, I shall\nhave nothing to wish for.\u201d\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat about ten\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted\nto a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he\nsaw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had\nthe advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a blue\ncoat and rode a black horse.\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping,\nwhen an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be\nin town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of\ntheir invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not\nimagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in\nHertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might always be flying about",
    "30": "from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to\nbe. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\nsoon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven\ngentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number\nof ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that,\ninstead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five\nsisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly-room, it\nconsisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\nof the eldest, and another young man.\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked\nthe gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room\nby his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report,\nwhich was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of\nhis having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\nfigure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr.\nBingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the\nevening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his\npopularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and\nabove being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save\nhim from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being\nunworthy to be compared with his friend.\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was\nangry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at\nNetherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a\ncontrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.\nHurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\nlady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking\noccasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the",
    "31": "proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he\nwould never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was\nMrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\nparticular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\nstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and\nMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend\nto join it.\n\u201cCome, Darcy,\u201d said he, \u201cI must have you dance. I hate to see you\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\ndance.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly\nacquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be\ninsupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in\nthe room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\u201d\n\u201cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\u201d cried Bingley, \u201cfor a kingdom!\nUpon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I\nhave this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly\npretty.\u201d\n\u201cYou are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said Mr.\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\u201cOh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of\nher sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say\nvery agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\u201d \u201cWhich do you mean?\u201d and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said, \u201cShe\nis tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour\nat present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other\nmen. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are\nwasting your time with me.\u201d",
    "32": "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful\ndisposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.\nMr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by\nhis sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,\nthough in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\nneighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be\nnever without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a\nball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village\nwhere they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They\nfound Mr. Bennet still up. With a book, he was regardless of time; and on\nthe present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\nevening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped\nthat all his wife\u2019s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\nfound that he had a very different story to hear.\n\u201cOh, my dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d as she entered the room, \u201cwe have had a\nmost delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she\nlooked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her\ntwice. Only think of that, my dear: he actually danced with her twice; and\nshe was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of\nall, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but,\nhowever, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and\nhe seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he\ninquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.\nThen, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\nMaria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with\nLizzy, and the Boulanger\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf he had had any compassion for me,\u201d cried her husband impatiently,\n\u201che would not have danced half so much! For God\u2019s sake, say no more of\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!\u201d",
    "33": "\u201cOh, my dear,\u201d continued Mrs. Bennet, \u201cI am quite delighted with him.\nHe is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I\nnever in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst\u2019s gown\u2014\u2014\u201d\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of\nthe subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\u201cBut I can assure you,\u201d she added, \u201cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not\nsuiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth\npleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring him! He\nwalked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not\nhandsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to\nhave given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\u201d",
    "34": "WHEN Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\ncautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how\nvery much she admired him.\n\u201cHe is just what a young-man ought to be,\u201d said she, \u201csensible, good\u0002humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with\nsuch perfect good breeding!\u201d\n\u201cHe is also handsome,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhich a young man ought\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\u201d\n\u201cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\ndid not expect such a compliment.\u201d\n\u201cDid not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us.\nCompliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be\nmore natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you\nwere about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No\nthanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I\ngive you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\u201d\n\u201cDear Lizzy!\u201d\n\u201cOh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in\nyour eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.\u201d\n\u201cI would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\nwhat I think.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do: and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good\nsense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!\nAffectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere.\nBut to be candid without ostentation or design,\u2014to take the good of\neverybody\u2019s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad,\u2014\nbelongs to you alone. And so, you like this man\u2019s sisters, too, do you? Their\nmanners are not equal to his.\u201d",
    "35": "\u201cCertainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his\nhouse; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\nneighbour in her.\u201d\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with\na judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little\ndisposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient\nin good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being\nagreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather\nhandsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town;\nhad a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending\nmore than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were,\ntherefore, in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly\nof others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a\ncircumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their\nbrother\u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes\nmade choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a good house\nand the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew\nthe easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his\ndays at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his\nhouse as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two\nyears when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at\nNetherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an hour; was\npleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the\nowner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the",
    "36": "easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could\noffer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never\nappeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\u2019s regard, Bingley had the\nfirmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding,\nDarcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was\nclever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his\nmanners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had\ngreatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he\nappeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\nsufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or\nprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with\nall the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more\nbeautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\nthere was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the\nsmallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss\nBennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much.\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired her\nand liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they\nshould not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established\nas a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to\nthink of her as he chose.",
    "37": "WITHIN a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\nBennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in\ntrade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to\nhis business and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them\nboth, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from\nMeryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he could think\nwith pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy\nhimself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank,\nit did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to\neverybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at\nSt. James\u2019s had made him courteous.\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of\nthem, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\nElizabeth\u2019s intimate friend.\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought\nthe former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n\u201cYou began the evening well, Charlotte,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. \u201cYou were Mr. Bingley\u2019s first choice.\u201d\n\u201cYes; but he seemed to like his second better.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\nsure that did seem as if he admired her\u2014indeed, I rather believe he did\u2014I\nheard something about it\u2014but I hardly know what\u2014something about Mr.\nRobinson.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson:\ndid not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\u2019s asking him how he liked our",
    "38": "Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many\npretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his\nanswering immediately to the last question, \u2018Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cUpon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed\u2014that does seem as\nif\u2014but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\u201d\n\u201cMy overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,\u201d said\nCharlotte. \u201cMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?\nPoor Eliza! to be only just tolerable.\u201d\n\u201cI beg you will not put it into Lizzy\u2019s head to be vexed by his ill\u0002treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a\nmisfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close\nto her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\u201d \u201cAre you quite sure, ma\u2019am? Is not there a little mistake?\u201d said Jane. \u201cI\ncertainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\u201d\n\u201cAy, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\nspoke to.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Bingley told me,\u201d said Jane, \u201cthat he never speaks much unless\namong his intimate acquaintance. With them he is remarkably agreeable.\u201d\n\u201cI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable,\nhe would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody\nsays that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that\nMrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come to the ball in a hack\nchaise.\u201d\n\u201cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cbut I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.\u201d\n\u201cAnother time, Lizzy,\u201d said her mother, \u201cI would not dance with him, if I\nwere you.\u201d\n\u201cI believe, ma\u2019am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.\u201d",
    "39": "\u201cHis pride,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cdoes not offend me so much as pride\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be\nproud.\u201d\n\u201cThat is very true,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cand I could easily forgive his\npride, if he had not mortified mine.\u201d\n\u201cPride,\u201d observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\nreflections, \u201cis a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever\nread, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is\nparticularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish\na feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\nimaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often\nused synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride\nrelates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have\nothers think of us.\u201d\n\u201cIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\u201d cried a young Lucas, who came with his\nsisters, \u201cI should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\u201d\n\u201cThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\u201d said Mrs.\nBennet; \u201cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\ndirectly.\u201d\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.",
    "40": "THE ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet\u2019s pleasing manners grew on the\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a\nwish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two\neldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but\nElizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly\nexcepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to\nJane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the\ninfluence of their brother\u2019s admiration. It was generally evident, whenever\nthey met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane\nwas yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him\nfrom the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered\nwith pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general,\nsince Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and\nan uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss Lucas.\n\u201cIt may, perhaps, be pleasant,\u201d replied Charlotte, \u201cto be able to impose\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so\nvery guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from\nthe object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then\nbe but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\nmuch of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to\nleave any to itself. We can all begin freely\u2014a slight preference is natural\nenough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in\nlove without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better\nshow more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly;\nbut he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\u201d\n\u201cBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover",
    "41": "it too.\u201d\n\u201cRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\u2019s disposition as you do.\u201d\n\u201cBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it,\nhe must find it out.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always\nsee each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment\nshould be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the\nmost of every half hour in which she can command his attention. When she\nis secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she\nchooses.\u201d\n\u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to\nget a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these\nare not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she cannot even\nbe certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She\nhas known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at\nMeryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in\ncompany with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her\nunderstand his character.\u201d\n\u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only\nhave discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember\nthat four evenings have been also spent together\u2014and four evenings may\ndo a great deal.\u201d\n\u201cYes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other leading\ncharacteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she\nwere married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of\nhappiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.\nHappiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of\nthe parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar\nbeforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always\ncontinue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\nvexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the\nperson with whom you are to pass your life.\u201d",
    "42": "\u201cYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\u201d\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\u2019s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her\nto be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when\nthey next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made\nit clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her\nface, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the\nbeautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some\nothers equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more\nthan one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to\nacknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\nthat her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by\ntheir easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was\nonly the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not\nthought her handsome enough to dance with.\nHe began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\u2019s, where a large party were\nassembled.\n\u201cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\u201d said she to Charlotte, \u201cby listening to my\nconversation with Colonel Forster?\u201d\n\u201cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\u201d\n\u201cBut if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see what\nhe is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being\nimpertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\u201d On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to\nhave any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention\nsuch a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\nturned to him and said,\u2014\n\u201cDid not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\nwell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at",
    "43": "Meryton?\u201d\n\u201cWith great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\nenergetic.\u201d\n\u201cYou are severe on us.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be her turn soon to be teased,\u201d said Miss Lucas. \u201cI am going to\nopen the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!\u2014always wanting\nme to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\na musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really\nrather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the\nvery best performers.\u201d On Miss Lucas\u2019s persevering, however, she added,\n\u201cVery well; if it must be so, it must.\u201d And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy,\n\u201cThere is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\nwith\u2014\u2018Keep your breath to cool your porridge,\u2019\u2014and I shall keep mine to\nswell my song.\u201d\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would\nsing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary,\nwho having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family,\nworked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for\ndisplay.\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner,\nwhich would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had\nreached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much\nmore pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a\nlong concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish\nairs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,\nand two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much\nengrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his\nneighbour, till Sir William thus began:\u2014\n\u201cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\nThere is nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\nrefinements of polished societies.\u201d",
    "44": "\u201cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.\u201d\nSir William only smiled. \u201cYour friend performs delightfully,\u201d he\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \u201cand I doubt not\nthat you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\nyou often dance at St. James\u2019s?\u201d\n\u201cNever, sir.\u201d\n\u201cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\u201d\n\u201cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\u201d\nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\u201cI had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would\nagree with Lady Lucas.\u201d\nHe paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck\nwith the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,\u2014\n\u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must\nallow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.\u201d\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,\u2014\n\u201cIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to\nsuppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\u201d\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all\nshake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n\u201cYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for\none half hour.\u201d",
    "45": "\u201cMr. Darcy is all politeness,\u201d said Elizabeth, smiling.\n\u201cHe is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\npartner?\u201d\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency,\nwhen thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\u2014\n\u201cI can guess the subject of your reverie.\u201d\n\u201cI should imagine not.\u201d\n\u201cYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\nevenings in this manner,\u2014in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of your\nopinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise\u2014the\nnothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these people! What would I\ngive to hear your strictures on them!\u201d\n\u201cYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which\na pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\u201d\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr.\nDarcy replied, with great intrepidity,\u2014\n\u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\u201d repeated Miss Bingley. \u201cI am all astonishment.\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\njoy?\u201d\n\u201cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\u2019s\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to\nmatrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\u201d\n\u201cNay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of\ncourse she will be always at Pemberley with you.\u201d\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain\nherself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was\nsafe, her wit flowed along.",
    "46": "MR. BENNET\u2019S property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in\ndefault of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\u2019s fortune,\nthough ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of\nhis. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four\nthousand pounds.\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in\na respectable line of trade.\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither\nthree or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner\u2019s\nshop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and\nLydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions: their minds were more\nvacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to\nMeryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish\nconversation for the evening; and, however bare of news the country in\ngeneral might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At\npresent, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by\nthe recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to\nremain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head-quarters.\nTheir visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\u2019\nnames and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length\nthey began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all,\nand this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They\ncould talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\u2019s large fortune, the\nmention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their\neyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.",
    "47": "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet\ncoolly observed,\u2014\n\u201cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am\nnow convinced.\u201d\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\nperfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,\nand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\nnext morning to London.\n\u201cI am astonished, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat you should be so\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of\nanybody\u2019s children, it should not be of my own, however.\u201d\n\u201cIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\u201d\n\u201cYes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had\nhoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far\ndiffer from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\nfoolish.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense\nof their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not\nthink about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked\na red coat myself very well\u2014and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a\nsmart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of\nmy girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked\nvery becoming the other night at Sir William\u2019s in his regimentals.\u201d\n\u201cMamma,\u201d cried Lydia, \u201cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson\u2019s as they did when they first\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\u2019s library.\u201d\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with\na note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for\nan answer. Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly\ncalling out, while her daughter read,\u2014\n\u201cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\u201d\n\u201cIt is from Miss Bingley,\u201d said Jane, and then read it aloud.",
    "48": "\u201cMy dear friend,\n\u201cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,\nwe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives; for a\nwhole day\u2019s t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between two women can never end without a\nquarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. My brother and the\ngentlemen are to dine with the officers. Yours ever, \u201cCAROLINE BINGLEY\"\n\u201cWith the officers!\u201d cried Lydia: \u201cI wonder my aunt did not tell us of\nthat.\u201d\n\u201cDining out,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet; \u201cthat is very unlucky.\u201d\n\u201cCan I have the carriage?\u201d said Jane.\n\u201cNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\nrain; and then you must stay all night.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be a good scheme,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cif you were sure that\nthey would not offer to send her home.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley\u2019s chaise to go to Meryton;\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.\u201d\n\u201cI had much rather go in the coach.\u201d\n\u201cBut, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?\u201d \u201cThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\u201d\n\u201cBut if you have got them to-day,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmy mother\u2019s purpose\nwill be answered.\u201d\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained\nhard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The\nrain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could\nnot come back.",
    "49": "\u201cThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.\nBreakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the\nfollowing note for Elizabeth:\u2014\n\u201cMy dearest Lizzie,\n\u201cI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\nimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear\nof my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\nJones\u2014therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to\nme\u2014and, excepting a sore throat and a headache, there is not much the\nmatter with me.\n\u201cYours, etc.\u201d\n\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud, \u201cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness\u2014if she\nshould die\u2014it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr.\nBingley, and under your orders.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\ncolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all\nvery well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\u201d\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n\u201cHow can you be so silly,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cas to think of such a thing,\nin all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.\u201d\n\u201cI shall be very fit to see Jane\u2014which is all I want.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,\u201d said her father, \u201cto send for the horses?\u201d\n\u201cNo, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\u201d\n\u201cI admire the activity of your benevolence,\u201d observed Mary, \u201cbut every\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion\nshould always be in proportion to what is required.\u201d\n\u201cWe will go as far as Meryton with you,\u201d said Catherine and Lydia.\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off"
