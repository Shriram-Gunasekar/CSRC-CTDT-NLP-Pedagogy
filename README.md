#Credits
CSRC (Centre For Sponsored Research And Consultancy)/CTDT (Centre For Technology Development And Transfer) of Anna University sanctioned this project to be developed from July 2022 - December 2022. 
It was reviewed by the expert evaluation committee and approved on National Science Day, Feb 28, 2023 in Anna University, Chennai.

This project is a web app that offers a variety of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services in the context of developing a pedagogical tool for solely academic purposes, bound by F.A.T.E. principles.
It is highly customizable and now made open source thanks to the funding for development by CSRC.
All library dependencies in this project have wheels to be built on a Raspberry Pi, tested on a 64-bit Raspberry Pi Debian Bullseye OS with Python 3.9, specially done so that institutions can establish this as a service in their own campuses with a cheap RPi4 configured as a server. Testing was done on a Model 4 B (8GB RAM).
